    question_text: the treaty of paris left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure the second continental congress had drawn up articles of confederation on november 15 1777 to regularize its own status these described a permanent confederation but granted to the congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced there was no president and no judiciaryalthough historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fastgrowing nation together they do give congress credit for resolving the conflict between the states over ownership of the western territories the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control the land ordinance of 1785 and northwest ordinance created territorial government set up protocols for the admission of new states the division of land into useful units and set aside land in each township for public use this system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization as in europe and provided the basis for the rest of american continental expansion through the 19th centuryby 1783 with the end of the british blockade the new nation was regaining its prosperity however trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilist policies of the european powers before the war the americans had shipped food and other products to the british colonies in the caribbean but now these ports were closed since only british ships could trade there france and spain had similar policies for their empires the former imposed restrictions on imports of new england fish and chesapeake tobacco new orleans was closed by the spanish hampering settlement of the west although it didn't stop frontiersmen from pouring west in great numbers simultaneously american manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again the inability of the congress to redeem the currency or the public debts incurred during the war or to facilitate trade and financial links among the states aggravated a gloomy situation in 1786–87 shays's rebellion an uprising of farmers in western massachusetts against the state court system threatened the stability of state government and the congress was powerless to helpthe continental congress did have power to print paper money it printed so much that its value plunged until the expression not worth a continental was used for some worthless item congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states which did not respond generously less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 although the states had been asked for two million in 1783 alone in 1785 alexander hamilton issued a curt statement that the treasury had received absolutely no taxes from new york for the yearstates handled their debts with varying levels of success the south for the most part refused to pay its debts off which was damaging to local banks but virginia north carolina and georgia fared well due to their production of cash crops such as cotton and tobacco south carolina would have done the same except for a series of crop failures maryland suffered from financial chaos and political infighting new york and pennsylvania fared well although the latter also suffered from political quarrels new jersey new hampshire delaware and connecticut struggled massachusetts was in a state of virtual civil war see above and suffered from high taxes and the decline of its economy rhode island alone among the new england states prospered and mostly because of its notorious harboring of pirates and smugglerswhen adams went to london in 1785 as the first representative of the united states he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws meanwhile each state acted individually against great britain to little effect when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping connecticut hastened to profit by opening its portsby 1787 congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resists attacks upon private contracts and public credit land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier populationthe idea of a convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor alexander hamilton realized while serving as washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress hamilton led a group of likeminded nationalists won washington's endorsement and convened the annapolis convention in 1786 to petition congress to call a constitutional

    question_text: george washington a renowned hero of the american revolutionary war commander of the continental army and president of the constitutional convention was unanimously chosen as the first president of the united states under the new us constitution all the leaders of the new nation were committed to republicanism and the doubts of the antifederalists of 1788 were allayed with the passage of a bill of rights as the first ten amendments to the constitution in 1791the first census conducted by secretary of state thomas jefferson enumerated a population of 39 million with a density of 45 people per square mile of land area there were only 12 cities of more than 5000 population as the great majority of the people were farmerscongress passed the judiciary act of 1789 which established the entire federal judiciary at the time the act provided for a supreme court of six justices three circuit courts and 13 district courts it also created the offices of us marshal deputy marshal and district attorney in each federal judicial district the compromise of 1790 located the national capital in the southern state of maryland now the district of columbia and enabled the federal assumption of state debtswashington had hoped that his secretary of the treasury would be robert morris celebrated philadelphia merchant and socalled financier of the revolution but he declined and instead the post went to the president's young former aidedecamp alexander hamilton who with washington's support and jefferson's opposition convinced congress to pass a farreaching financial program that was patterned after the system developed in england a century earlier it funded the debts of the american revolution set up a national bank and set up a system of tariffs and taxes his policies had the effect of linking the economic interests of the states and of wealthy americans to the success of the national government as well as enhancing the international financial standing of the new nationmost representatives of the south opposed hamilton's plan because they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it but more importantly there were early signs of the economic and cultural rift between the northern and southern states that was to burst into flames seven decades later being that the south and its plantationbased economy resisted the idea of a centralized federal government and being subordinated to northeastern business interests despite considerable opposition in congress from southerners hamilton's plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790 the first bank of the united states was thus created that year despite arguments from thomas jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government hamilton's other proposals including protection tariffs for nascent american industry were defeatedthe whiskey rebellion happened in 1794—when settlers in the monongahela valley of western pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money it was the first serious test of the federal government washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court by august 1794 the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion and on august 7 several thousand armed settlers gathered near pittsburgh pennsylvania washington then invoked the militia law of 1792 to summon the militias of several states a force of 13000 men was organized and washington personally led it to western pennsylvania the revolt immediately collapsed and there was no violenceforeign policy unexpectedly took center stage starting in 1793 when revolutionary france became engulfed in war with the rest of europe an event that was to lead to 22 years of fighting france claimed that its 1778 alliance with the us meant that the latter was bound to come to their aid the washington administration's policy of neutrality was widely supported but the jeffersonians strongly favored france and deeply distrusted the british who they saw as enemies of republicanism in addition they sought to annex spanish territory in the south and west meanwhile hamilton and the business community favored britain which was by far america's largest trading partner the republicans gained support in the winter of 179394 as britain seized american merchant ships and impressed their crews into the royal navy but the tensions were resolved with the jay treaty of 1794 which opened up 10 years of prosperous trade in exchange for which britain would remove troops from its fortifications along the canadian border the jeffersonians viewed the treaty as a surrender to british moneyed interests and mobilized their supporters nationwide to defeat the treaty the federalists likewise rallied supporters in a vicious conflict which continued until 1795 when washington publicly intervened in the debate using his prestige to secure ratification by this point the economic and political advantages of the federalist position had become clear to all concerned combined with growing disdain for france after the reign of terror and jacobin antireligious policies jefferson promptly resigned as secretary of state historian george herring notes the remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains produced by the jay treatycontinuing conflict between hamilton and jefferson especially over foreign policy led to the formation of the federalist and republican parties although washington remained aloof and warned against political parties in his farewell address he generally supported hamilton and hamiltonian programs over those of jefferson the democraticrepublican party dominated the upper south western frontier and in parts of the middle states federalist support was concentrated in the major northern cities and south carolina after his death in 1799 he became the great symbolic hero of the federalists

    question_text: under washington and adams the federalists had established a strong government but sometimes it followed policies that alienated the citizenry for example in 1798 to pay for the rapidly expanding army and navy the federalists had enacted a new tax on houses land and slaves affecting every property owner in the country in the fries's rebellion hundreds of farmers in pennsylvania revolted—federalists saw a breakdown in civil society some tax resisters were arrested—then pardoned by adams republicans denounced this action as an example of federalist tyrannyjefferson had steadily gathered behind him a great mass of small farmers shopkeepers and other workers which asserted themselves as democraticrepublicans in the election of 1800 jefferson enjoyed extraordinary favor because of his appeal to american idealism in his inaugural address the first such speech in the new capital of washington dc he promised a wise and frugal government to preserve order among the inhabitants but would leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvementjefferson encouraged agriculture and westward expansion most notably by the louisiana purchase and subsequent lewis and clark expedition believing america to be a haven for the oppressed he reduced the residency requirement for naturalization back to five years againby the end of his second term jefferson and secretary of the treasury albert gallatin had reduced the national debt to less than 560 million this was accomplished by reducing the number of executive department employees and army and navy officers and enlisted men and by otherwise curtailing government and military spendingjefferson's domestic policy was uneventful and handsoff the administration mainly concerning itself with foreign affairs and particularly territorial expansion except for gallatin's reforms their main preoccupation was purging the government of federalist judges the president and his associates were widely distrustful of the judicial branch especially because adams had made several midnight appointments prior to leaving office in march 1801 in marbury vs madison 1803 the supreme court under john marshall established the precedent of being able to review and overturn legislation passed by congress this upset jefferson to the point where his administration began opening impeachment hearings against judges that were perceived as abusing their power the attempted purge of the judicial branch reached its climax with the trial of justice samuel chase when chase was acquitted jefferson abandoned his campaignto protect its shipping interests overseas the us fought the first barbary war 1801–1805 in north africa this was followed later by the second barbary war 1815with the upcoming expiration of the 20year ban on congressional action on the subject jefferson a lifelong enemy of the slave trade called on congress to criminalize the international slave trade calling it violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of africa and which the morality the reputation and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe

    question_text: the louisiana purchase in 1803 gave western farmers use of the important mississippi river waterway removed the french presence from the western border of the united states and most important provided us settlers with vast potential for expansion a few weeks afterward war resumed between britain and napoleon's france the united states dependent on european revenues from the export of agricultural goods tried to export food and raw materials to both warring great powers and to profit from transporting goods between their home markets and caribbean colonies both sides permitted this trade when it benefited them but opposed it when it did not following the 1805 destruction of the french navy at the battle of trafalgar britain sought to impose a stranglehold over french overseas trade ties thus in retaliation against us trade practices britain imposed a loose blockade of the american coast believing that britain could not rely on other sources of food than the united states congress and president jefferson suspended all us trade with foreign nations in the embargo act of 1807 hoping to get the british to end their blockade of the american coast the embargo act however devastated american agricultural exports and weakened american ports while britain found other sources of foodjames madison won the us presidential election of 1808 largely on the strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when britain and france were both on the brink of war with the united states he was quick to repeal the embargo act refreshing american seaports unfortunately despite his intellectual brilliance madison lacked jefferson's leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor's policies verbatim he tried various trade restrictions to try and force britain and france to respect freedom of the seas but they were unsuccessful the british had undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the french and spanish fleet at trafalgar in 1805 and they took advantage of this to seize american ships at will and force their sailors into serving the royal navy even worse the size of the us navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the first national bank expired and congress declined to renew it a clamor for military action thus erupted just as relations with britain and france were at a low point and the us's ability to wage war had been reducedin response to continued british interference with american shipping including the practice of impressment of american sailors into the british navy and to british aid to american indians in the old northwest the twelfth congress—led by southern and western jeffersonians—declared war on britain in 1812 westerners and southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports new england was making a fine profit and its federalists opposed the war almost to the point of secession the federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national rolethe united states and britain came to a draw in the war after bitter fighting that lasted even after the burning of washington in august 1814 and andrew jackson's smashing defeat of the british invasion army at the battle of new orleans in january 1815 the treaty of ghent officially ending the war returned to the status quo ante bellum but britain's alliance with the native americans ended and the indians were the major losers of the war news of the victory at new orleans over the best british combat troops came at the same time as news of the peace giving americans a psychological triumph and opening the era of good feelings the war destroyed the federalist party and opened roles as national candidates to generals andrew jackson and william henry harrison among others as well as civilian leaders james monroe john quincy adams and henry clay

    question_text: starting in the 1820s american politics became more democratic as many state and local offices went from being appointed to elective and the old requirements for voters to own property were abolished voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties and by the 1830s in every state except south carolina presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters jacksonian democracy drew its support from the small farmers of the west and the workers artisans and small merchants of the east they favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an industrial nation built on finance and manufacturing the entrepreneurs for whom henry clay and daniel webster were heroes fought back and formed the whig partypolitical machines appeared early in the history of the united states and for all the exhortations of jacksonian democracy it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates in addition the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists and much legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate as a consequence the chance of single issue and ideologybased candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituenciesexamples of single issue parties included the antimasonic party which emerged in the northeastern states its goal was to outlaw freemasonry as a violation of republicanism members were energized by reports that a man who threatened to expose masonic secrets had been murdered they ran a candidate for president william wirt in 1832 he won 8 of the popular vote nationwide carried vermont and ran well in rural pennsylvania and massachusetts the party then merged into the new whig party others included abolitionist parties workers' parties like the workingmen's party the locofocos who opposed monopolies and assorted nativist parties who denounced the roman catholic church as a threat to republicanism in the united states none of these parties were capable of mounting a broad enough appeal to voters or winning major electionsthe election of 1828 was a significant benchmark marking the climax of the trend toward broader voter eligibility and participation vermont had universal male suffrage since its entry into the union and tennessee permitted suffrage for the vast majority of taxpayers new jersey maryland and south carolina all abolished property and taxpaying requirements between 1807 and 1810 states entering the union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement from 1815 to 1821 connecticut massachusetts and new york abolished all property requirements in 1824 members of the electoral college were still selected by six state legislatures by 1828 presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but delaware and south carolina nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the election of andrew jackson in addition the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the west as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs

    question_text: even before the nullification issue had been settled another controversy arose to challenge jackson's leadership it concerned the rechartering of the second bank of the united states the first bank of the united states had been established in 1791 under alexander hamilton's guidance and had been chartered for a 20year period after the revolutionary war the united states had a large war debt to france and others and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray as state banks printed their own currency and the plethora of different bank notes made commerce difficult hamilton's national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency while it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade it was resented by westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men when its charter expired in 1811 it was not renewedfor the next few years the banking business was in the hands of statechartered banks which issued currency in excessive amounts creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency the absence of a national bank during the war of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government therefore a second bank of the united states was created in 1816from its inception the second bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country's credit and currency and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite jackson elected as a popular champion against it vetoed a bill to recharter the bank he also personally detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth in his message to congress he denounced monopoly and special privilege saying that our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits but have besought us to make them richer by act of congressin the election campaign that followed the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant manufacturing and financial interests generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates and the laboring and agrarian sectors who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased money supply and lower interest rates the outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of jacksonism jackson saw his reelection in 1832 as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably he found a readymade weapon in a provision of the bank's charter authorizing removal of public fundsin september 1833 jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government carefully selected state banks stringently restricted were provided as a substitute for the next generation the us would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system this banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics it was not until the civil war that the federal government again chartered a national bankjackson groomed martin van buren as his successor and he was easily elected president in 1836 however a few months into his administration the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the panic of 1837 caused in large part by excessive speculation banks failed and unemployment soared although the depression had its roots in jackson's economic policies van buren was blamed for the disaster in the 1840 presidential election he was defeated by the whig candidate william henry harrison however his presidency would prove a nonstarter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office john tyler his vice president succeeded him tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency and was widely referred to as his accidency the whigs expelled him and he became a president without a partyeconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the jacksonian era for the most part they follow the conclusions of peter temin who absolved jackson's policies and blamed international events beyond american control such as conditions in mexico china and britain a survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with temin's conclusion that the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond president jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did visavis the second bank of the us

    question_text: zagarri 2007 argues the revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of women and created an environment favorable to women's participation in politics she asserts that for a brief decades a comprehensive transformation in women's rights roles and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable p 8 however the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women's rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political lifeduring the building of the new republic american women were able to gain a limited political voice in what is known as republican motherhood under this philosophy as promoted by leaders such as abigail adams women were seen as the protectors of liberty and republicanism mothers were charged with passing down these ideals to their children through instruction of patriotic thoughts and feelings during the 1830s and 1840s many of the changes in the status of women that occurred in the postrevolutionary period—such as the belief in love between spouses and the role of women in the home—continued at an accelerated pace this was an age of reform movements in which americans sought to improve the moral fiber of themselves and of their nation in unprecedented numbers the wife's role in this process was important because she was seen as the cultivator of morality in her husband and children besides domesticity women were also expected to be pious pure and submissive to men these four components were considered by many at the time to be the natural state of womanhood echoes of this ideology still existing today the view that the wife should find fulfillment in these values is called the cult of true womanhood or the cult of domesticityin the south tradition still abounded with society women on the pedestal and dedicated to entertaining and hosting others this phenomenon is reflected in the 1965 book the inevitable guest based on a collection of letters by friends and relatives in north and south carolina to miss jemima darby a distant relative of the authorunder the doctrine of two spheres women were to exist in the domestic sphere at home while their husbands operated in the public sphere of politics and business women took on the new role of softening their husbands and instructing their children in piety and not republican values while men handled the business and financial affairs of the family some doctors of this period even went so far as to suggest that women should not get an education lest they divert blood away from the uterus to the brain and produce weak children the coverture laws ensured that men would hold political power over their wives

    question_text: manifest destiny was the belief that american settlers were destined to expand across the continent this concept was born out of a sense of mission to redeem the old world by high example  generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven the phrase manifest destiny meant many different things to many different people and was rejected by many americans howe argues that american imperialism did not represent an american consensus it provoked bitter dissent within the national polityfaragher's analysis of the political polarization between the democratic party and the whig party is thatmost democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion whereas many whigs especially in the north were opposed whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries they feared correctly that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories on the other hand many democrats feared industrialization the whigs welcomed  for many democrats the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow thomas jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrializationmanifest destiny did however provide the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of us territory it was used by democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with mexico it was also used to threaten war with britain but president polk negotiated a compromise that divided the oregon country half and half merk concludesfrom the outset manifest destiny — vast in program in its sense of continentalism—was slight in support it lacked national sectional or party following commensurate with its bigness the reason was it did not reflect the national spirit the thesis that it embodied nationalism found in much historical writing is backed by little real supporting evidence

    question_text: george washington elected the first president in 1789 set up a cabinet form of government with departments of state treasury and war along with an attorney general the justice department was created in 1870 based in new york the new government acted quickly to rebuild the nation's financial structure enacting the program of treasury secretary alexander hamilton the government assumed the revolutionary war debts of the states and the national government and refinanced them with new federal bonds it paid for the program through new tariffs and taxes the tax on whiskey led to a revolt in the west washington raised an army and suppressed it the nation adopted a bill of rights as 10 amendments to the new constitution the judiciary act of 1789 established the entire federal judiciary including the supreme court the supreme court became important under the leadership of chief justice john marshall 1801–1835 federalist and nationalist who built a strong supreme court and strengthened the national governmentthe 1790s were highly contentious as the first party system emerged in the contest between hamilton and his federalist party and thomas jefferson and his republican party washington and hamilton were building a strong national government with a broad financial base and the support of merchants and financiers throughout the country jeffersonians opposed the new national bank the navy and federal taxes the federalists favored britain which was embattled in a series of wars with france jefferson's victory in 1800 opened the era of jeffersonian democracy and doomed the uppercrust federalists to increasingly marginal rolesthe louisiana purchase from napoleon in 1803 opened vast western expanses of fertile land that exactly met the needs of the rapidly expanding population of yeomen farmers whom jefferson championedthe americans declared war on britain the war of 1812 to uphold american honor at sea and to end the indian raids in the west despite incompetent government management and a series of defeats early on americans found new generals like andrew jackson william henry harrison and winfield scott who repulsed british invasions and broke the alliance between the british and the indians that held up settlement of the old northwest the federalists who had opposed the war to the point of trading with the enemy and threatening secession were devastated by the triumphant ending of the war the remaining indians east of the mississippi were kept on reservations or moved via the trail of tears to reservations in what later became oklahomathe spread of democracy opened the ballot box to nearly all white men allowing the jacksonian democracy to dominate politics during the second party system whigs representing wealthier planters merchants financiers and professionals wanted to modernize the society using tariffs and federally funded internal improvements they were blocked by the jacksonians who closed down the national bank in the 1830s the jacksonians wanted expansion—that is manifest destiny—into new lands that would be occupied by farmers and planters thanks to the annexation of texas the defeat of mexico in war and a compromise with britain the western third of the nation rounded out the continental united states by 1848howe 2007 argues that the transformation america underwent was not so much political democratization but rather the explosive growth of technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication—the telegraph railroads the post office and an expanding print industry they made possible the religious revivals of the second great awakening the expansion of education and social reform they modernized party politics and speeded up business by enabling the fast efficient movement of goods money and people across an expanding nation they transformed a looseknit collection of parochial agricultural communities into a powerful cosmopolitan nation economic modernization proceeded rapidly thanks to highly profitable cotton crops in the south new textile and machinemaking industries in the northeast and a fast developing transportation infrastructurebreaking loose from european models the americans developed their own high culture notably in literature and in higher education the second great awakening brought revivals across the country forming new denominations and greatly increasing church membership especially among methodists and baptists by the 1840s increasing numbers of immigrants were arriving from europe especially british irish and germans many settled in the cities which were starting to emerge as a major factor in the economy and societythe whigs had warned that annexation of texas would lead to a crisis over slavery and they were proven right by the turmoil of the 1850s that led to the civil war

    question_text: george washington a renowned hero of the american revolutionary war commander of the continental army and president of the constitutional convention was unanimously chosen as the first president of the united states under the new us constitution all the leaders of the new nation were committed to republicanism and the doubts of the antifederalists of 1788 were allayed with the passage of a bill of rights as the first ten amendments to the constitution in 1791the first census conducted by secretary of state thomas jefferson enumerated a population of 39 million with a density of 45 people per square mile of land area there were only 12 cities of more than 5000 population as the great majority of the people were farmerscongress passed the judiciary act of 1789 which established the entire federal judiciary at the time the act provided for a supreme court of six justices three circuit courts and 13 district courts it also created the offices of us marshal deputy marshal and district attorney in each federal judicial district the compromise of 1790 located the national capital in the southern state of maryland now the district of columbia and enabled the federal assumption of state debtswashington had hoped that his secretary of the treasury would be robert morris celebrated philadelphia merchant and socalled financier of the revolution but he declined and instead the post went to the president's young former aidedecamp alexander hamilton who with washington's support and jefferson's opposition convinced congress to pass a farreaching financial program that was patterned after the system developed in england a century earlier it funded the debts of the american revolution set up a national bank and set up a system of tariffs and taxes his policies had the effect of linking the economic interests of the states and of wealthy americans to the success of the national government as well as enhancing the international financial standing of the new nationmost representatives of the south opposed hamilton's plan because they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it but more importantly there were early signs of the economic and cultural rift between the northern and southern states that was to burst into flames seven decades later being that the south and its plantationbased economy resisted the idea of a centralized federal government and being subordinated to northeastern business interests despite considerable opposition in congress from southerners hamilton's plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790 the first bank of the united states was thus created that year despite arguments from thomas jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government hamilton's other proposals including protection tariffs for nascent american industry were defeatedthe whiskey rebellion happened in 1794—when settlers in the monongahela valley of western pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money it was the first serious test of the federal government washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court by august 1794 the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion and on august 7 several thousand armed settlers gathered near pittsburgh pennsylvania washington then invoked the militia law of 1792 to summon the militias of several states a force of 13000 men was organized and washington personally led it to western pennsylvania the revolt immediately collapsed and there was no violenceforeign policy unexpectedly took center stage starting in 1793 when revolutionary france became engulfed in war with the rest of europe an event that was to lead to 22 years of fighting france claimed that its 1778 alliance with the us meant that the latter was bound to come to their aid the washington administration's policy of neutrality was widely supported but the jeffersonians strongly favored france and deeply distrusted the british who they saw as enemies of republicanism in addition they sought to annex spanish territory in the south and west meanwhile hamilton and the business community favored britain which was by far america's largest trading partner the republicans gained support in the winter of 179394 as britain seized american merchant ships and impressed their crews into the royal navy but the tensions were resolved with the jay treaty of 1794 which opened up 10 years of prosperous trade in exchange for which britain would remove troops from its fortifications along the canadian border the jeffersonians viewed the treaty as a surrender to british moneyed interests and mobilized their supporters nationwide to defeat the treaty the federalists likewise rallied supporters in a vicious conflict which continued until 1795 when washington publicly intervened in the debate using his prestige to secure ratification by this point the economic and political advantages of the federalist position had become clear to all concerned combined with growing disdain for france after the reign of terror and jacobin antireligious policies jefferson promptly resigned as secretary of state historian george herring notes the remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains produced by the jay treatycontinuing conflict between hamilton and jefferson especially over foreign policy led to the formation of the federalist and republican parties although washington remained aloof and warned against political parties in his farewell address he generally supported hamilton and hamiltonian programs over those of jefferson the democraticrepublican party dominated the upper south western frontier and in parts of the middle states federalist support was concentrated in the major northern cities and south carolina after his death in 1799 he became the great symbolic hero of the federalists

    question_text: under washington and adams the federalists had established a strong government but sometimes it followed policies that alienated the citizenry for example in 1798 to pay for the rapidly expanding army and navy the federalists had enacted a new tax on houses land and slaves affecting every property owner in the country in the fries's rebellion hundreds of farmers in pennsylvania revolted—federalists saw a breakdown in civil society some tax resisters were arrested—then pardoned by adams republicans denounced this action as an example of federalist tyrannyjefferson had steadily gathered behind him a great mass of small farmers shopkeepers and other workers which asserted themselves as democraticrepublicans in the election of 1800 jefferson enjoyed extraordinary favor because of his appeal to american idealism in his inaugural address the first such speech in the new capital of washington dc he promised a wise and frugal government to preserve order among the inhabitants but would leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvementjefferson encouraged agriculture and westward expansion most notably by the louisiana purchase and subsequent lewis and clark expedition believing america to be a haven for the oppressed he reduced the residency requirement for naturalization back to five years againby the end of his second term jefferson and secretary of the treasury albert gallatin had reduced the national debt to less than 560 million this was accomplished by reducing the number of executive department employees and army and navy officers and enlisted men and by otherwise curtailing government and military spendingjefferson's domestic policy was uneventful and handsoff the administration mainly concerning itself with foreign affairs and particularly territorial expansion except for gallatin's reforms their main preoccupation was purging the government of federalist judges the president and his associates were widely distrustful of the judicial branch especially because adams had made several midnight appointments prior to leaving office in march 1801 in marbury vs madison 1803 the supreme court under john marshall established the precedent of being able to review and overturn legislation passed by congress this upset jefferson to the point where his administration began opening impeachment hearings against judges that were perceived as abusing their power the attempted purge of the judicial branch reached its climax with the trial of justice samuel chase when chase was acquitted jefferson abandoned his campaignto protect its shipping interests overseas the us fought the first barbary war 1801–1805 in north africa this was followed later by the second barbary war 1815with the upcoming expiration of the 20year ban on congressional action on the subject jefferson a lifelong enemy of the slave trade called on congress to criminalize the international slave trade calling it violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of africa and which the morality the reputation and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe

    question_text: the louisiana purchase in 1803 gave western farmers use of the important mississippi river waterway removed the french presence from the western border of the united states and most important provided us settlers with vast potential for expansion a few weeks afterward war resumed between britain and napoleon's france the united states dependent on european revenues from the export of agricultural goods tried to export food and raw materials to both warring great powers and to profit from transporting goods between their home markets and caribbean colonies both sides permitted this trade when it benefited them but opposed it when it did not following the 1805 destruction of the french navy at the battle of trafalgar britain sought to impose a stranglehold over french overseas trade ties thus in retaliation against us trade practices britain imposed a loose blockade of the american coast believing that britain could not rely on other sources of food than the united states congress and president jefferson suspended all us trade with foreign nations in the embargo act of 1807 hoping to get the british to end their blockade of the american coast the embargo act however devastated american agricultural exports and weakened american ports while britain found other sources of foodjames madison won the us presidential election of 1808 largely on the strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when britain and france were both on the brink of war with the united states he was quick to repeal the embargo act refreshing american seaports unfortunately despite his intellectual brilliance madison lacked jefferson's leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor's policies verbatim he tried various trade restrictions to try and force britain and france to respect freedom of the seas but they were unsuccessful the british had undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the french and spanish fleet at trafalgar in 1805 and they took advantage of this to seize american ships at will and force their sailors into serving the royal navy even worse the size of the us navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the first national bank expired and congress declined to renew it a clamor for military action thus erupted just as relations with britain and france were at a low point and the us's ability to wage war had been reducedin response to continued british interference with american shipping including the practice of impressment of american sailors into the british navy and to british aid to american indians in the old northwest the twelfth congress—led by southern and western jeffersonians—declared war on britain in 1812 westerners and southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports new england was making a fine profit and its federalists opposed the war almost to the point of secession the federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national rolethe united states and britain came to a draw in the war after bitter fighting that lasted even after the burning of washington in august 1814 and andrew jackson's smashing defeat of the british invasion army at the battle of new orleans in january 1815 the treaty of ghent officially ending the war returned to the status quo ante bellum but britain's alliance with the native americans ended and the indians were the major losers of the war news of the victory at new orleans over the best british combat troops came at the same time as news of the peace giving americans a psychological triumph and opening the era of good feelings the war destroyed the federalist party and opened roles as national candidates to generals andrew jackson and william henry harrison among others as well as civilian leaders james monroe john quincy adams and henry clay

    question_text: starting in the 1820s american politics became more democratic as many state and local offices went from being appointed to elective and the old requirements for voters to own property were abolished voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties and by the 1830s in every state except south carolina presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters jacksonian democracy drew its support from the small farmers of the west and the workers artisans and small merchants of the east they favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an industrial nation built on finance and manufacturing the entrepreneurs for whom henry clay and daniel webster were heroes fought back and formed the whig partypolitical machines appeared early in the history of the united states and for all the exhortations of jacksonian democracy it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates in addition the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists and much legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate as a consequence the chance of single issue and ideologybased candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituenciesexamples of single issue parties included the antimasonic party which emerged in the northeastern states its goal was to outlaw freemasonry as a violation of republicanism members were energized by reports that a man who threatened to expose masonic secrets had been murdered they ran a candidate for president william wirt in 1832 he won 8 of the popular vote nationwide carried vermont and ran well in rural pennsylvania and massachusetts the party then merged into the new whig party others included abolitionist parties workers' parties like the workingmen's party the locofocos who opposed monopolies and assorted nativist parties who denounced the roman catholic church as a threat to republicanism in the united states none of these parties were capable of mounting a broad enough appeal to voters or winning major electionsthe election of 1828 was a significant benchmark marking the climax of the trend toward broader voter eligibility and participation vermont had universal male suffrage since its entry into the union and tennessee permitted suffrage for the vast majority of taxpayers new jersey maryland and south carolina all abolished property and taxpaying requirements between 1807 and 1810 states entering the union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement from 1815 to 1821 connecticut massachusetts and new york abolished all property requirements in 1824 members of the electoral college were still selected by six state legislatures by 1828 presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but delaware and south carolina nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the election of andrew jackson in addition the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the west as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs

    question_text: even before the nullification issue had been settled another controversy arose to challenge jackson's leadership it concerned the rechartering of the second bank of the united states the first bank of the united states had been established in 1791 under alexander hamilton's guidance and had been chartered for a 20year period after the revolutionary war the united states had a large war debt to france and others and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray as state banks printed their own currency and the plethora of different bank notes made commerce difficult hamilton's national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency while it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade it was resented by westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men when its charter expired in 1811 it was not renewedfor the next few years the banking business was in the hands of statechartered banks which issued currency in excessive amounts creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency the absence of a national bank during the war of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government therefore a second bank of the united states was created in 1816from its inception the second bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country's credit and currency and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite jackson elected as a popular champion against it vetoed a bill to recharter the bank he also personally detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth in his message to congress he denounced monopoly and special privilege saying that our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits but have besought us to make them richer by act of congressin the election campaign that followed the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant manufacturing and financial interests generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates and the laboring and agrarian sectors who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased money supply and lower interest rates the outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of jacksonism jackson saw his reelection in 1832 as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably he found a readymade weapon in a provision of the bank's charter authorizing removal of public fundsin september 1833 jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government carefully selected state banks stringently restricted were provided as a substitute for the next generation the us would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system this banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics it was not until the civil war that the federal government again chartered a national bankjackson groomed martin van buren as his successor and he was easily elected president in 1836 however a few months into his administration the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the panic of 1837 caused in large part by excessive speculation banks failed and unemployment soared although the depression had its roots in jackson's economic policies van buren was blamed for the disaster in the 1840 presidential election he was defeated by the whig candidate william henry harrison however his presidency would prove a nonstarter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office john tyler his vice president succeeded him tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency and was widely referred to as his accidency the whigs expelled him and he became a president without a partyeconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the jacksonian era for the most part they follow the conclusions of peter temin who absolved jackson's policies and blamed international events beyond american control such as conditions in mexico china and britain a survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with temin's conclusion that the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond president jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did visavis the second bank of the us

    question_text: manifest destiny was the belief that american settlers were destined to expand across the continent this concept was born out of a sense of mission to redeem the old world by high example  generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven the phrase manifest destiny meant many different things to many different people and was rejected by many americans howe argues that american imperialism did not represent an american consensus it provoked bitter dissent within the national polityfaragher's analysis of the political polarization between the democratic party and the whig party is thatmost democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion whereas many whigs especially in the north were opposed whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries they feared correctly that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories on the other hand many democrats feared industrialization the whigs welcomed  for many democrats the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow thomas jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrializationmanifest destiny did however provide the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of us territory it was used by democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with mexico it was also used to threaten war with britain but president polk negotiated a compromise that divided the oregon country half and half merk concludesfrom the outset manifest destiny — vast in program in its sense of continentalism—was slight in support it lacked national sectional or party following commensurate with its bigness the reason was it did not reflect the national spirit the thesis that it embodied nationalism found in much historical writing is backed by little real supporting evidence

    question_text: george washington elected the first president in 1789 set up a cabinet form of government with departments of state treasury and war along with an attorney general the justice department was created in 1870 based in new york the new government acted quickly to rebuild the nation's financial structure enacting the program of treasury secretary alexander hamilton the government assumed the revolutionary war debts of the states and the national government and refinanced them with new federal bonds it paid for the program through new tariffs and taxes the tax on whiskey led to a revolt in the west washington raised an army and suppressed it the nation adopted a bill of rights as 10 amendments to the new constitution the judiciary act of 1789 established the entire federal judiciary including the supreme court the supreme court became important under the leadership of chief justice john marshall 1801–1835 federalist and nationalist who built a strong supreme court and strengthened the national governmentthe 1790s were highly contentious as the first party system emerged in the contest between hamilton and his federalist party and thomas jefferson and his republican party washington and hamilton were building a strong national government with a broad financial base and the support of merchants and financiers throughout the country jeffersonians opposed the new national bank the navy and federal taxes the federalists favored britain which was embattled in a series of wars with france jefferson's victory in 1800 opened the era of jeffersonian democracy and doomed the uppercrust federalists to increasingly marginal rolesthe louisiana purchase from napoleon in 1803 opened vast western expanses of fertile land that exactly met the needs of the rapidly expanding population of yeomen farmers whom jefferson championedthe americans declared war on britain the war of 1812 to uphold american honor at sea and to end the indian raids in the west despite incompetent government management and a series of defeats early on americans found new generals like andrew jackson william henry harrison and winfield scott who repulsed british invasions and broke the alliance between the british and the indians that held up settlement of the old northwest the federalists who had opposed the war to the point of trading with the enemy and threatening secession were devastated by the triumphant ending of the war the remaining indians east of the mississippi were kept on reservations or moved via the trail of tears to reservations in what later became oklahomathe spread of democracy opened the ballot box to nearly all white men allowing the jacksonian democracy to dominate politics during the second party system whigs representing wealthier planters merchants financiers and professionals wanted to modernize the society using tariffs and federally funded internal improvements they were blocked by the jacksonians who closed down the national bank in the 1830s the jacksonians wanted expansion—that is manifest destiny—into new lands that would be occupied by farmers and planters thanks to the annexation of texas the defeat of mexico in war and a compromise with britain the western third of the nation rounded out the continental united states by 1848howe 2007 argues that the transformation america underwent was not so much political democratization but rather the explosive growth of technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication—the telegraph railroads the post office and an expanding print industry they made possible the religious revivals of the second great awakening the expansion of education and social reform they modernized party politics and speeded up business by enabling the fast efficient movement of goods money and people across an expanding nation they transformed a looseknit collection of parochial agricultural communities into a powerful cosmopolitan nation economic modernization proceeded rapidly thanks to highly profitable cotton crops in the south new textile and machinemaking industries in the northeast and a fast developing transportation infrastructurebreaking loose from european models the americans developed their own high culture notably in literature and in higher education the second great awakening brought revivals across the country forming new denominations and greatly increasing church membership especially among methodists and baptists by the 1840s increasing numbers of immigrants were arriving from europe especially british irish and germans many settled in the cities which were starting to emerge as a major factor in the economy and societythe whigs had warned that annexation of texas would lead to a crisis over slavery and they were proven right by the turmoil of the 1850s that led to the civil war

    question_text: george washington a renowned hero of the american revolutionary war commander of the continental army and president of the constitutional convention was unanimously chosen as the first president of the united states under the new us constitution all the leaders of the new nation were committed to republicanism and the doubts of the antifederalists of 1788 were allayed with the passage of a bill of rights as the first ten amendments to the constitution in 1791the first census conducted by secretary of state thomas jefferson enumerated a population of 39 million with a density of 45 people per square mile of land area there were only 12 cities of more than 5000 population as the great majority of the people were farmerscongress passed the judiciary act of 1789 which established the entire federal judiciary at the time the act provided for a supreme court of six justices three circuit courts and 13 district courts it also created the offices of us marshal deputy marshal and district attorney in each federal judicial district the compromise of 1790 located the national capital in the southern state of maryland now the district of columbia and enabled the federal assumption of state debtswashington had hoped that his secretary of the treasury would be robert morris celebrated philadelphia merchant and socalled financier of the revolution but he declined and instead the post went to the president's young former aidedecamp alexander hamilton who with washington's support and jefferson's opposition convinced congress to pass a farreaching financial program that was patterned after the system developed in england a century earlier it funded the debts of the american revolution set up a national bank and set up a system of tariffs and taxes his policies had the effect of linking the economic interests of the states and of wealthy americans to the success of the national government as well as enhancing the international financial standing of the new nationmost representatives of the south opposed hamilton's plan because they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it but more importantly there were early signs of the economic and cultural rift between the northern and southern states that was to burst into flames seven decades later being that the south and its plantationbased economy resisted the idea of a centralized federal government and being subordinated to northeastern business interests despite considerable opposition in congress from southerners hamilton's plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790 the first bank of the united states was thus created that year despite arguments from thomas jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government hamilton's other proposals including protection tariffs for nascent american industry were defeatedthe whiskey rebellion happened in 1794—when settlers in the monongahela valley of western pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money it was the first serious test of the federal government washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court by august 1794 the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion and on august 7 several thousand armed settlers gathered near pittsburgh pennsylvania washington then invoked the militia law of 1792 to summon the militias of several states a force of 13000 men was organized and washington personally led it to western pennsylvania the revolt immediately collapsed and there was no violenceforeign policy unexpectedly took center stage starting in 1793 when revolutionary france became engulfed in war with the rest of europe an event that was to lead to 22 years of fighting france claimed that its 1778 alliance with the us meant that the latter was bound to come to their aid the washington administration's policy of neutrality was widely supported but the jeffersonians strongly favored france and deeply distrusted the british who they saw as enemies of republicanism in addition they sought to annex spanish territory in the south and west meanwhile hamilton and the business community favored britain which was by far america's largest trading partner the republicans gained support in the winter of 179394 as britain seized american merchant ships and impressed their crews into the royal navy but the tensions were resolved with the jay treaty of 1794 which opened up 10 years of prosperous trade in exchange for which britain would remove troops from its fortifications along the canadian border the jeffersonians viewed the treaty as a surrender to british moneyed interests and mobilized their supporters nationwide to defeat the treaty the federalists likewise rallied supporters in a vicious conflict which continued until 1795 when washington publicly intervened in the debate using his prestige to secure ratification by this point the economic and political advantages of the federalist position had become clear to all concerned combined with growing disdain for france after the reign of terror and jacobin antireligious policies jefferson promptly resigned as secretary of state historian george herring notes the remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains produced by the jay treatycontinuing conflict between hamilton and jefferson especially over foreign policy led to the formation of the federalist and republican parties although washington remained aloof and warned against political parties in his farewell address he generally supported hamilton and hamiltonian programs over those of jefferson the democraticrepublican party dominated the upper south western frontier and in parts of the middle states federalist support was concentrated in the major northern cities and south carolina after his death in 1799 he became the great symbolic hero of the federalists

    question_text: the first party system between 1792 and 1824 featured two national parties competing for control of the presidency congress and the states the federalist party was created by alexander hamilton and was dominant to 1800 the rival republican party democraticrepublican party was created by thomas jefferson and james madison and was dominant after 1800 both parties originated in national politics but moved to organize supporters and voters in every state these comprised probably the first modern party system in the world because they were based on voters not factions of aristocrats at court or parliament the federalists appealed to the business community the republicans to the planters and farmers by 1796 politics in every state was nearly monopolized by the two partiesjefferson wrote on feb 12 1798two political sects have arisen within the u s the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support the other that like the analogous branch in the english government it is already too strong for the republican parts of the constitution and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers the former of these are called federalists sometimes aristocrats or monocrats and sometimes tories after the corresponding sect in the english government of exactly the same definition the latter are stiled republicans whigs jacobins anarchists disorganizers etc these terms are in familiar use with most personsthe federalists promoted the financial system of treasury secretary hamilton which emphasized federal assumption of state debts a tariff to pay off those debts a national bank to facilitate financing and encouragement of banking and manufacturing the republicans based in the plantation south opposed a strong executive power were hostile to a standing army and navy demanded a limited reading of the constitutional powers of the federal government and strongly opposed the hamilton financial program perhaps even more important was foreign policy where the federalists favored britain because of its political stability and its close ties to american trade while the republicans admired the french and the french revolution jefferson was especially fearful that british aristocratic influences would undermine republicanism britain and france were at war 1793–1815 with one brief interruption american policy was neutrality with the federalists hostile to france and the republicans hostile to britain the jay treaty of 1794 marked the decisive mobilization of the two parties and their supporters in every state president washington while officially nonpartisan generally supported the federalists and that party made washington their iconic hero

    question_text: the louisiana purchase in 1803 gave western farmers use of the important mississippi river waterway removed the french presence from the western border of the united states and most important provided us settlers with vast potential for expansion a few weeks afterward war resumed between britain and napoleon's france the united states dependent on european revenues from the export of agricultural goods tried to export food and raw materials to both warring great powers and to profit from transporting goods between their home markets and caribbean colonies both sides permitted this trade when it benefited them but opposed it when it did not following the 1805 destruction of the french navy at the battle of trafalgar britain sought to impose a stranglehold over french overseas trade ties thus in retaliation against us trade practices britain imposed a loose blockade of the american coast believing that britain could not rely on other sources of food than the united states congress and president jefferson suspended all us trade with foreign nations in the embargo act of 1807 hoping to get the british to end their blockade of the american coast the embargo act however devastated american agricultural exports and weakened american ports while britain found other sources of foodjames madison won the us presidential election of 1808 largely on the strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when britain and france were both on the brink of war with the united states he was quick to repeal the embargo act refreshing american seaports unfortunately despite his intellectual brilliance madison lacked jefferson's leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor's policies verbatim he tried various trade restrictions to try and force britain and france to respect freedom of the seas but they were unsuccessful the british had undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the french and spanish fleet at trafalgar in 1805 and they took advantage of this to seize american ships at will and force their sailors into serving the royal navy even worse the size of the us navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the first national bank expired and congress declined to renew it a clamor for military action thus erupted just as relations with britain and france were at a low point and the us's ability to wage war had been reducedin response to continued british interference with american shipping including the practice of impressment of american sailors into the british navy and to british aid to american indians in the old northwest the twelfth congress—led by southern and western jeffersonians—declared war on britain in 1812 westerners and southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports new england was making a fine profit and its federalists opposed the war almost to the point of secession the federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national rolethe united states and britain came to a draw in the war after bitter fighting that lasted even after the burning of washington in august 1814 and andrew jackson's smashing defeat of the british invasion army at the battle of new orleans in january 1815 the treaty of ghent officially ending the war returned to the status quo ante bellum but britain's alliance with the native americans ended and the indians were the major losers of the war news of the victory at new orleans over the best british combat troops came at the same time as news of the peace giving americans a psychological triumph and opening the era of good feelings the war destroyed the federalist party and opened roles as national candidates to generals andrew jackson and william henry harrison among others as well as civilian leaders james monroe john quincy adams and henry clay

    question_text: starting in the 1820s american politics became more democratic as many state and local offices went from being appointed to elective and the old requirements for voters to own property were abolished voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties and by the 1830s in every state except south carolina presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters jacksonian democracy drew its support from the small farmers of the west and the workers artisans and small merchants of the east they favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an industrial nation built on finance and manufacturing the entrepreneurs for whom henry clay and daniel webster were heroes fought back and formed the whig partypolitical machines appeared early in the history of the united states and for all the exhortations of jacksonian democracy it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates in addition the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists and much legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate as a consequence the chance of single issue and ideologybased candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituenciesexamples of single issue parties included the antimasonic party which emerged in the northeastern states its goal was to outlaw freemasonry as a violation of republicanism members were energized by reports that a man who threatened to expose masonic secrets had been murdered they ran a candidate for president william wirt in 1832 he won 8 of the popular vote nationwide carried vermont and ran well in rural pennsylvania and massachusetts the party then merged into the new whig party others included abolitionist parties workers' parties like the workingmen's party the locofocos who opposed monopolies and assorted nativist parties who denounced the roman catholic church as a threat to republicanism in the united states none of these parties were capable of mounting a broad enough appeal to voters or winning major electionsthe election of 1828 was a significant benchmark marking the climax of the trend toward broader voter eligibility and participation vermont had universal male suffrage since its entry into the union and tennessee permitted suffrage for the vast majority of taxpayers new jersey maryland and south carolina all abolished property and taxpaying requirements between 1807 and 1810 states entering the union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement from 1815 to 1821 connecticut massachusetts and new york abolished all property requirements in 1824 members of the electoral college were still selected by six state legislatures by 1828 presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but delaware and south carolina nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the election of andrew jackson in addition the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the west as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs

    question_text: toward the end of his first term in office jackson was forced to confront the state of south carolina on the issue of the protective tariff the protective tariff passed by congress and signed into law by jackson in 1832 was milder than that of 1828 but it further embittered many in the state in response several south carolina citizens endorsed the states rights principle of nullification which was enunciated by john c calhoun jackson's vice president until 1832 in his south carolina exposition and protest 1828 south carolina dealt with the tariff by adopting the ordinance of nullification which declared both the tariff of 1828 and the tariff of 1832 null and void within state bordersnullification was only the most recent in a series of state challenges to the authority of the federal government in response to south carolina's threat jackson sent seven small naval vessels and a manofwar to charleston in november 1832 on december 10 he issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers south carolina the president declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that union for which their ancestors had foughtsenator henry clay though an advocate of protection and a political rival of jackson piloted a compromise measure through congress clay's 1833 compromise tariff specified that all duties more than 20 of the value of the goods imported were to be reduced by easy stages so that by 1842 the duties on all articles would reach the level of the moderate tariff of 1816the rest of the south declared south carolina's course unwise and unconstitutional eventually south carolina rescinded its action jackson had committed the federal government to the principle of union supremacy south carolina however had obtained many of the demands it sought and had demonstrated that a single state could force its will on congress

    question_text: even before the nullification issue had been settled another controversy arose to challenge jackson's leadership it concerned the rechartering of the second bank of the united states the first bank of the united states had been established in 1791 under alexander hamilton's guidance and had been chartered for a 20year period after the revolutionary war the united states had a large war debt to france and others and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray as state banks printed their own currency and the plethora of different bank notes made commerce difficult hamilton's national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency while it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade it was resented by westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men when its charter expired in 1811 it was not renewedfor the next few years the banking business was in the hands of statechartered banks which issued currency in excessive amounts creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency the absence of a national bank during the war of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government therefore a second bank of the united states was created in 1816from its inception the second bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country's credit and currency and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite jackson elected as a popular champion against it vetoed a bill to recharter the bank he also personally detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth in his message to congress he denounced monopoly and special privilege saying that our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits but have besought us to make them richer by act of congressin the election campaign that followed the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant manufacturing and financial interests generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates and the laboring and agrarian sectors who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased money supply and lower interest rates the outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of jacksonism jackson saw his reelection in 1832 as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably he found a readymade weapon in a provision of the bank's charter authorizing removal of public fundsin september 1833 jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government carefully selected state banks stringently restricted were provided as a substitute for the next generation the us would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system this banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics it was not until the civil war that the federal government again chartered a national bankjackson groomed martin van buren as his successor and he was easily elected president in 1836 however a few months into his administration the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the panic of 1837 caused in large part by excessive speculation banks failed and unemployment soared although the depression had its roots in jackson's economic policies van buren was blamed for the disaster in the 1840 presidential election he was defeated by the whig candidate william henry harrison however his presidency would prove a nonstarter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office john tyler his vice president succeeded him tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency and was widely referred to as his accidency the whigs expelled him and he became a president without a partyeconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the jacksonian era for the most part they follow the conclusions of peter temin who absolved jackson's policies and blamed international events beyond american control such as conditions in mexico china and britain a survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with temin's conclusion that the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond president jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did visavis the second bank of the us

    question_text: the steady expansion and rapid population growth of the united states after 1815 contrasted sharply with static european societies as visitors described the rough sometimes violent but on the whole hugely optimistic and forwardlooking attitude of most americans while land ownership was something most europeans could only dream of contemporary accounts show that the average american farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than european peasants and could make provisions for land for his children europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of american society which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful for example in germany the universities the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status in britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons for tens of thousands of pounds rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in europe but they seldom had social prestige or political power by contrast the us had more millionaires than any country in europe by 1850 most rich americans had welltodo fathers but their grandfathers were of average wealth poor boys of the 1850s like andrew carnegie and john d rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900 historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time and over generations with the carnegielike ragstoriches scenario a rare one some ethnic groups like yankees irish and jews prized upward mobility and emphasized education as the fastest route other groups such as germans poles and italians emphasized family stability and home ownership more stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers often out west

    question_text: manifest destiny was the belief that american settlers were destined to expand across the continent this concept was born out of a sense of mission to redeem the old world by high example  generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven the phrase manifest destiny meant many different things to many different people and was rejected by many americans howe argues that american imperialism did not represent an american consensus it provoked bitter dissent within the national polityfaragher's analysis of the political polarization between the democratic party and the whig party is thatmost democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion whereas many whigs especially in the north were opposed whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries they feared correctly that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories on the other hand many democrats feared industrialization the whigs welcomed  for many democrats the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow thomas jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrializationmanifest destiny did however provide the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of us territory it was used by democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with mexico it was also used to threaten war with britain but president polk negotiated a compromise that divided the oregon country half and half merk concludesfrom the outset manifest destiny — vast in program in its sense of continentalism—was slight in support it lacked national sectional or party following commensurate with its bigness the reason was it did not reflect the national spirit the thesis that it embodied nationalism found in much historical writing is backed by little real supporting evidence

    question_text: by the 1840s the industrial revolution was transforming the northeast with a dense network of railroads canals textile mills small industrial cities and growing commercial centers with hubs in boston new york city and philadelphia although manufacturing interests especially in pennsylvania sought a high tariff the actual tariff in effect was low and was reduced several times with the 1857 tariff the lowest in decades the midwest region based on farming and increasingly on animal production was growing rapidly using the railroads and river systems to ship food to slave plantations in the south industrial cities in the east and industrial cities in britain and europein the south the cotton plantations were flourishing thanks to the very high price of cotton on the world market cotton production wears out the land and so the center of gravity was continually moving west the annexation of texas in 1845 opened up the last great cotton lands meanwhile other commodities such as tobacco in virginia and north carolina were in the doldrums slavery was dying out in the upper south and survived because of sales of slaves to the growing cotton plantations in the southwest while the northeast was rapidly urbanizing and urban centers such as cleveland cincinnati and chicago were rapidly growing in the midwest the south remained overwhelmingly rural the great wealth generated by slavery was used to buy new lands and more slaves at all times the great majority of southern whites owned no slaves and operated farms on a subsistence basis serving small local marketsa transportation revolution was underway thanks to heavy infusions of capital from london paris boston new york and philadelphia hundreds of local short haul lines were being consolidated to form a railroad system that could handle longdistance shipment of farm and industrial products as well as passengers in the south there were few systems and most railroad lines were short haul project designed to move cotton to the nearest river or ocean port meanwhile steamboats provided a good transportation system on the inland riverswith the use of interchangeable parts popularized by eli whitney the factory system began in which workers assembled at one location to produce goods the early textile factories such as those in lowell massachusetts employed mainly women but generally factories were a male domainby 1860 16 of americans lived in cities with 2500 or more people a third of the nation's income came from manufacturing urbanized industry was limited primarily to the northeast cotton cloth production was the leading industry with the manufacture of shoes woolen clothing and machinery also expanding energy was provided in most cases by water power from the rivers but steam engines were being introduced to factories as well by 1860 the railroads had made a transition from use of local wood supplies to coal for their locomotives pennsylvania became the center of the coal industry many if not most of the factory workers and miners were recent immigrants from europe or their children throughout the north and in southern cities entrepreneurs were setting up factories mines mills banks stores and other business operations in the great majority of cases these were relatively small locally owned and locally operated enterprises

    question_text: on march 6 1857 the supreme court became involved in the crisis dred scott a black slave was taken by his master dr john emerson in 1834 from missouri a slave state to illinois a free state scott was then taken to what later became minnesota in 1838 they moved back to st louis in 1846 where his owner died dred scott then sued emerson's wife for his freedom claiming that living in a nonslave territory made him a free man the case eventually reached the supreme court where chief justice taney declared that dred scott was a slave not a citizen and thus had no rights under the constitution his ruling was significant because the supreme court had decided that slaves were not citizens of the united states and that no black could ever become a citizen since they were beings of an inferior order and lesscapable it also stated that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional because of the fifth amendment the missouri compromise unlawfully took away property without due process thus dred scott was not free scott was bought by the sons of his first owner and freed but he died of tuberculosis a year later on september 17 1858the decision strengthened northern opposition to slavery and lent substance to the republican charge that a slave power controlled the supreme court politically it was trivial since the kansasnebraska act had already nullified the missouri compromise symbolically however the supreme court had sanctioned the hardline southern view this emboldened southerners to demand even more rights for slavery just as northern opposition hardened

    question_text: reconstruction was the period from 1863 to 1877 in which the federal government temporarily took control—one by one—of the southern states of the confederacy before his assassination in april 1865 president abraham lincoln had announced moderate plans for reconstruction to reintegrate the former confederates as fast as possible lincoln set up the freedmen's bureau in march 1865 to aid former slaves in finding education health care and employment the final abolition of slavery was achieved by the thirteenth amendment ratified in december 1865 however lincoln was opposed by the radical republicans within his own party who feared that the former confederates would never truly give up on slavery and confederate nationalism and would always try to reinstate them behindthescenes as a result the radical republicans tried to impose legal restrictions that would strip most exrebels' rights to vote and hold elected office the radicals were opposed by lincoln's vice president and successor tennessee democrat andrew johnson however the radicals won the critical elections of 1866 winning enough seats in congress to override president johnson's vetoes of such legislation they even successfully impeached president johnson in the house of representatives and almost removed him from office in the senate in 1868 meanwhile they gave the south's freedmen new constitutional and federal legal protectionsthe radicals' reconstruction plans took effect in 1867 under the supervision of the us army allowing a republican coalition of freedmen scalawags sympathetic local whites and carpetbaggers recent arrivals from the north to take control of southern state governments they ratified the fourteenth amendment giving enormous new powers to the federal courts to deal with justice at the state level these state governments borrowed heavily to build railroads and public schools increasing taxation rates the backlash of increasingly fierce opposition to these policies drove most of the scalawags out of the republican party and into the democratic party president ulysses s grant enforced civil rights protections for africanamericans that were being challenged in south carolina mississippi and louisiana the fifteenth amendment was ratified in 1870 giving africanamericans the right to vote in american electionsus representative stevens was one of the major policymakers regarding reconstruction and obtained a house vote of impeachment against president andrew johnson hans trefousse his leading biographer concludes that stevens was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in congress he dominated the house with his wit knowledge of parliamentary law and sheer willpower even though he was often unable to prevailreconstruction ended at different times in each state the last in 1877 when republican rutherford b hayes won the contentious presidential election of 1876 over his opponent samuel j tilden to deal with disputed electoral votes congress set up an electoral commission it awarded the disputed votes to hayes the white south accepted the compromise of 1877 knowing that hayes proposed to end army control over the remaining three state governments in republican hands white northerners accepted that the civil war was over and that southern whites posed no threat to the nationthe end of reconstruction marked the end of the brief period of civil rights and civil liberties for african americans in the south where most lived reconstruction caused permanent resentment distrust and cynicism among white southerners toward the federal government and helped create the solid south which typically voted for the thensocially conservative democrats for all local state and national offices white supremacists created a segregated society through jim crow laws that made blacks secondclass citizens with very little political power or public voice the white elites called the redeemers—the southern wing of the bourbon democrats were in firm political and economic control of the south until the rise of the populist movement in the 1890s local law enforcement was weak in rural areas allowing outraged mobs to use lynching to redress allegedbutoftenunproven crimes charged to blackshistorians' interpretations of the radical republicans have dramatically shifted over the years from the pre1950 view of them as tools of big business motivated by partisanship and hatred of the white south to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slavesin the south itself the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s differed sharply by race americans often interpreted great events in religious terms historian wilson fallin contrasts the interpretation of civil war and reconstruction in white versus black using baptist sermons in alabama whites preachers expressed the view thatgod had chastised them and given them a special mission – to maintain orthodoxy strict bibnlicism personal piety and traditional race relations slavery they insisted had not been sinful rather emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of reconstruction was a clear sign of god's favorin sharp contrast black preachers interpreted the civil war emancipation and reconstruction asgod's gift of freedom they appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence to worship in their own way to affirm their worth and dignity and to proclaim the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man most of all they could form their own churches associations and conventions these institutions offered selfhelp and racial uplift and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed as a result black preachers continued to insist that god would protect and help him god would be there rock in a stormy landmost historians in the 21st century consider reconstruction to be a failure however historian mark summers in 2014 has argued thatif we see reconstruction's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled of a union held together forever of a north and south able to work together of slavery extirpated and sectional rivalries confined of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty backed by armed force then reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was a lasting and unappreciated success

    question_text: the first major effort to organize workers' groups on a nationwide basis appeared with the noble order of the knights of labor in 1869 originally a secret ritualistic society organized by philadelphia garment workers it was open to all workers including african americans women and farmers the knights grew slowly until they succeeded in facing down the great railroad baron jay gould in an 1885 strike within a year they added 500000 workers to their rolls far more than the thin leadership structure of the knights could handlethe knights of labor soon fell into decline and their place in the labor movement was gradually taken by the american federation of labor afl rather than open its membership to all the afl under former cigarmakers union official samuel gompers focused on skilled workers his objectives were pure and simple increasing wages reducing hours and improving working conditions as such gompers helped turn the labor movement away from the socialist views earlier labor leaders had espoused the afl would gradually become a respected organization in the us although it would have nothing to do with unskilled laborersin times of economic depression layoffs and wage cuts angered the workers leading to violent labor conflicts in 1877 and 1894 in the great railroad strike in 1877 railroad workers across the nation went on strike in response to a 10percent pay cut attempts to break the strike led to bloody uprisings in several cities the haymarket riot took place in 1886 when an anarchist allegedly threw a bomb at police dispersing a strike rally at the mccormick harvesting machine company in chicago at its peak the knights claimed 700000 members by 1890 membership had plummeted to fewer than 100000 then faded away the killing of policemen greatly embarrassed the knights of labor which was not involved with the bomb but which took much of the blamein the riots of 1892 at carnegie's steel works in homestead pennsylvania a group of 300 pinkerton detectives whom the company had hired to break a bitter strike by the amalgamated association of iron steel and tin workers were fired upon by strikers and 10 were killed as a result the national guard was called in to guard the plant nonunion workers were hired and the strike broken the homestead plant completely barred unions until 1937two years later wage cuts at the pullman palace car company just outside chicago led to a strike which with the support of the american railway union soon brought the nation's railway industry to a halt the shutdown of rail traffic meant the virtual shutdown of the entire national economy and president grover cleveland acted vigorously he secured injunctions in federal court which eugene debs and the other strike leaders ignored cleveland then sent in the army to stop the rioting and get the trains moving the strike collapsed as did the aruthe most militant working class organization of the 1905–1920 era was the industrial workers of the world iww formed largely in response to abysmal labor conditions in 1904 the year before its founding 27000 workers were killed on the job and discrimination against women minorities and unskilled laborers by other unions particularly the afl the wobblies as they were commonly known gained particular prominence from their incendiary and revolutionary rhetoric openly calling for class warfare direct action workplace democracy and one big union for all workers regardless of sex race or skills the wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike commonly known as the bread and roses strike in lawrence massachusetts they proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away but according to historian howard zinn the iww became a threat to the capitalist class exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge the iww strongly opposed the 1917–18 war effort and faced a campaign of repression from the federal government more than a few wobblies such as frank little were beaten or lynched by mobs or died in american jails the union exists to this day and has been involved in various labor disputes throughout the 2000s

    question_text: two years later woodrow wilson the democratic progressive governor of the state of new jersey campaigned against taft the republican candidate and against roosevelt who was appalled by his successor's policies and thus broke his earlier pledge to not run for a third term as the republicans would not nominate him he ran as a thirdparty progressive candidate but the ticket became widely known as the bull moose party the election was mainly a contest between roosevelt and wilson taft receiving little attention and carrying just eight electoral voteswilson in a spirited campaign defeated both rivals under his leadership the new congress enacted one of the most notable legislative programs in american history its first task was tariff revision the tariff duties must be altered wilson said we must abolish everything that bears any semblance of privilege the underwood tariff in 1913 provided substantial rate reductions on imported raw materials and foodstuffs cotton and woolen goods iron and steel and removed the duties from more than a hundred other items although the act retained many protective features it was a genuine attempt to lower the cost of living for american workersthe second item on the democratic program was a reorganization of the banking and currency system control said wilson must be public not private must be vested in the government itself so that the banks may be the instruments not the masters of business and of individual enterprise and initiativepassage of the federal reserve act of 1913 was one of wilson's most enduring legislative accomplishments for he successfully negotiated a compromise between wall street and the agrarians the plan built on ideas developed by senator nelson aldrich who discovered the european nations had more efficient central banks that helped their internal business and international trade the new organization divided the country into 12 districts with a federal reserve bank in each all supervised by a federal reserve board these banks were owned by local banks and served as depositories for the cash reserves of member banks until the federal reserve act the us government had left control of its money supply largely to unregulated private banks while the official medium of exchange was gold coins most loans and payments were carried out with bank notes backed by the promise of redemption in gold the trouble with this system was that the banks were tempted to reach beyond their cash reserves prompting periodic panics during which fearful depositors raced to turn their bank paper into coin with the passage of the act greater flexibility in the money supply was assured and provision was made for issuing federal reserve notes—paper dollars—to meet business demands the fed opened in 1914 and played a central role in funding the world war after 1914 issues of money and banking faded away from the political agendato resolve the longstanding dispute over trusts the wilson administration dropped the trustbusting legal strategies of roosevelt and taft and relied on the new federal trade commission to issue orders prohibiting unfair methods of competition by business concerns in interstate trade in addition a second law the clayton antitrust act forbade many corporate practices that had thus far escaped specific condemnation—interlocking directorates price discrimination among purchasers use of the injunction in labor disputes and ownership by one corporation of stock in similar enterprises after 1914 the trust issue faded away from politicsthe adamson act of 1916 established an eighthour day for railroad labor and solidified the ties between the labor unions and the democratic party the record of achievement won wilson a firm place in american history as one of the nation's foremost liberal reformers wilson's domestic reputation would soon be overshadowed by his record as a wartime president who led his country to victory but could not hold the support of his people for the peace that followed

    question_text: reconstruction was the period from 1863 to 1877 in which the federal government temporarily took control—one by one—of the southern states of the confederacy before his assassination in april 1865 president abraham lincoln had announced moderate plans for reconstruction to reintegrate the former confederates as fast as possible lincoln set up the freedmen's bureau in march 1865 to aid former slaves in finding education health care and employment the final abolition of slavery was achieved by the thirteenth amendment ratified in december 1865 however lincoln was opposed by the radical republicans within his own party who feared that the former confederates would never truly give up on slavery and confederate nationalism and would always try to reinstate them behindthescenes as a result the radical republicans tried to impose legal restrictions that would strip most exrebels' rights to vote and hold elected office the radicals were opposed by lincoln's vice president and successor tennessee democrat andrew johnson however the radicals won the critical elections of 1866 winning enough seats in congress to override president johnson's vetoes of such legislation they even successfully impeached president johnson in the house of representatives and almost removed him from office in the senate in 1868 meanwhile they gave the south's freedmen new constitutional and federal legal protectionsthe radicals' reconstruction plans took effect in 1867 under the supervision of the us army allowing a republican coalition of freedmen scalawags sympathetic local whites and carpetbaggers recent arrivals from the north to take control of southern state governments they ratified the fourteenth amendment giving enormous new powers to the federal courts to deal with justice at the state level these state governments borrowed heavily to build railroads and public schools increasing taxation rates the backlash of increasingly fierce opposition to these policies drove most of the scalawags out of the republican party and into the democratic party president ulysses s grant enforced civil rights protections for africanamericans that were being challenged in south carolina mississippi and louisiana the fifteenth amendment was ratified in 1870 giving africanamericans the right to vote in american electionsus representative stevens was one of the major policymakers regarding reconstruction and obtained a house vote of impeachment against president andrew johnson hans trefousse his leading biographer concludes that stevens was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in congress he dominated the house with his wit knowledge of parliamentary law and sheer willpower even though he was often unable to prevailreconstruction ended at different times in each state the last in 1877 when republican rutherford b hayes won the contentious presidential election of 1876 over his opponent samuel j tilden to deal with disputed electoral votes congress set up an electoral commission it awarded the disputed votes to hayes the white south accepted the compromise of 1877 knowing that hayes proposed to end army control over the remaining three state governments in republican hands white northerners accepted that the civil war was over and that southern whites posed no threat to the nationthe end of reconstruction marked the end of the brief period of civil rights and civil liberties for african americans in the south where most lived reconstruction caused permanent resentment distrust and cynicism among white southerners toward the federal government and helped create the solid south which typically voted for the thensocially conservative democrats for all local state and national offices white supremacists created a segregated society through jim crow laws that made blacks secondclass citizens with very little political power or public voice the white elites called the redeemers—the southern wing of the bourbon democrats were in firm political and economic control of the south until the rise of the populist movement in the 1890s local law enforcement was weak in rural areas allowing outraged mobs to use lynching to redress allegedbutoftenunproven crimes charged to blackshistorians' interpretations of the radical republicans have dramatically shifted over the years from the pre1950 view of them as tools of big business motivated by partisanship and hatred of the white south to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slavesin the south itself the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s differed sharply by race americans often interpreted great events in religious terms historian wilson fallin contrasts the interpretation of civil war and reconstruction in white versus black using baptist sermons in alabama whites preachers expressed the view thatgod had chastised them and given them a special mission – to maintain orthodoxy strict bibnlicism personal piety and traditional race relations slavery they insisted had not been sinful rather emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of reconstruction was a clear sign of god's favorin sharp contrast black preachers interpreted the civil war emancipation and reconstruction asgod's gift of freedom they appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence to worship in their own way to affirm their worth and dignity and to proclaim the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man most of all they could form their own churches associations and conventions these institutions offered selfhelp and racial uplift and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed as a result black preachers continued to insist that god would protect and help him god would be there rock in a stormy landmost historians in the 21st century consider reconstruction to be a failure however historian mark summers in 2014 has argued thatif we see reconstruction's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled of a union held together forever of a north and south able to work together of slavery extirpated and sectional rivalries confined of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty backed by armed force then reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was a lasting and unappreciated success

    question_text: the first major effort to organize workers' groups on a nationwide basis appeared with the noble order of the knights of labor in 1869 originally a secret ritualistic society organized by philadelphia garment workers it was open to all workers including african americans women and farmers the knights grew slowly until they succeeded in facing down the great railroad baron jay gould in an 1885 strike within a year they added 500000 workers to their rolls far more than the thin leadership structure of the knights could handlethe knights of labor soon fell into decline and their place in the labor movement was gradually taken by the american federation of labor afl rather than open its membership to all the afl under former cigarmakers union official samuel gompers focused on skilled workers his objectives were pure and simple increasing wages reducing hours and improving working conditions as such gompers helped turn the labor movement away from the socialist views earlier labor leaders had espoused the afl would gradually become a respected organization in the us although it would have nothing to do with unskilled laborersin times of economic depression layoffs and wage cuts angered the workers leading to violent labor conflicts in 1877 and 1894 in the great railroad strike in 1877 railroad workers across the nation went on strike in response to a 10percent pay cut attempts to break the strike led to bloody uprisings in several cities the haymarket riot took place in 1886 when an anarchist allegedly threw a bomb at police dispersing a strike rally at the mccormick harvesting machine company in chicago at its peak the knights claimed 700000 members by 1890 membership had plummeted to fewer than 100000 then faded away the killing of policemen greatly embarrassed the knights of labor which was not involved with the bomb but which took much of the blamein the riots of 1892 at carnegie's steel works in homestead pennsylvania a group of 300 pinkerton detectives whom the company had hired to break a bitter strike by the amalgamated association of iron steel and tin workers were fired upon by strikers and 10 were killed as a result the national guard was called in to guard the plant nonunion workers were hired and the strike broken the homestead plant completely barred unions until 1937two years later wage cuts at the pullman palace car company just outside chicago led to a strike which with the support of the american railway union soon brought the nation's railway industry to a halt the shutdown of rail traffic meant the virtual shutdown of the entire national economy and president grover cleveland acted vigorously he secured injunctions in federal court which eugene debs and the other strike leaders ignored cleveland then sent in the army to stop the rioting and get the trains moving the strike collapsed as did the aruthe most militant working class organization of the 1905–1920 era was the industrial workers of the world iww formed largely in response to abysmal labor conditions in 1904 the year before its founding 27000 workers were killed on the job and discrimination against women minorities and unskilled laborers by other unions particularly the afl the wobblies as they were commonly known gained particular prominence from their incendiary and revolutionary rhetoric openly calling for class warfare direct action workplace democracy and one big union for all workers regardless of sex race or skills the wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike commonly known as the bread and roses strike in lawrence massachusetts they proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away but according to historian howard zinn the iww became a threat to the capitalist class exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge the iww strongly opposed the 1917–18 war effort and faced a campaign of repression from the federal government more than a few wobblies such as frank little were beaten or lynched by mobs or died in american jails the union exists to this day and has been involved in various labor disputes throughout the 2000s

    question_text: by 1880 the granger movement began to decline and was replaced by the farmers' alliance from the beginning the farmers' alliance were political organizations with elaborate economic programs according to one early platform its purpose was to unite the farmers of america for their protection against class legislation and the encroachments of concentrated capital their program also called for the regulation—if not the outright nationalization—of the railroads currency inflation to provide debt relief the lowering of the tariff and the establishment of governmentowned storehouses and lowinterest lending facilities these were known as the ocala demandsduring the late 1880s a series of droughts devastated the west western kansas lost half its population during a fouryear span by 1890 the level of agrarian distress was at an alltime high mary elizabeth lease a noted populist writer and agitator told farmers that they needed to raise less corn and more hell working with sympathetic democrats in the south and small third parties in the west the farmer's alliance made a push for political power from these elements a new political party known as the populist party emerged the elections of 1890 brought the new party into coalitions that controlled parts of state government in a dozen southern and western states and sent a score of populist senators and representatives to congressits first convention was in 1892 when delegates from farm labor and reform organizations met in omaha nebraska determined at last to make their mark on a us political system that they viewed as hopelessly corrupted by the monied interests of the industrial and commercial truststhe pragmatic portion of the populist platform focused on issues of land railroads and money including the unlimited coinage of silver the populists showed impressive strength in the west and south in the 1892 elections and their candidate for president polled more than a million votes it was the currency question however pitting advocates of silver against those who favored gold that soon overshadowed all other issues agrarian spokesmen in the west and south demanded a return to the unlimited coinage of silver convinced that their troubles stemmed from a shortage of money in circulation they argued that increasing the volume of money would indirectly raise prices for farm products and drive up industrial wages thus allowing debts to be paid with inflated dollarsconservative groups and the financial classes on the other hand believed that such a policy would be disastrous and they insisted that inflation once begun could not be stopped railroad bonds the most important financial instrument of the time were payable in gold if fares and freight rates were set in halfprice silver dollars railroads would go bankrupt in weeks throwing hundreds of thousands of men out of work and destroying the industrial economy only the gold standard they said offered stabilitythe financial panic of 1893 heightened the tension of this debate bank failures abounded in the south and midwest unemployment soared and crop prices fell badly the crisis and president cleveland's inability to solve it nearly broke the democratic partythe democratic party which supported silver and free trade absorbed the remnants of the populist movement as the presidential elections of 1896 neared the democratic convention that year was witness to one of the most famous speeches in us political history pleading with the convention not to crucify mankind on a cross of gold william jennings bryan the young nebraskan champion of silver won the democrats' presidential nomination the remaining populists also endorsed bryan hoping to retain some influence by having a voice inside the bryan movement despite carrying the south and all the west except california and oregon bryan lost the more populated industrial north and east—and the election—to the republican william mckinley with his campaign slogan a full dinner pailin 1897 the economy began to improve mostly from restored business confidence silverites—who did not realize that most transactions were handled by bank checks not sacks of gold—believed the new prosperity was spurred by the discovery of gold in the yukon in 1898 the spanish–american war drew the nation's attention further away from populist issues if the movement was dead however its ideas were not once the populists supported an idea it became so tainted that the vast majority of american politicians rejected it only years later after the taint had been forgotten was it possible to achieve populist reforms such as the direct popular election of senators

    question_text: two years later woodrow wilson the democratic progressive governor of the state of new jersey campaigned against taft the republican candidate and against roosevelt who was appalled by his successor's policies and thus broke his earlier pledge to not run for a third term as the republicans would not nominate him he ran as a thirdparty progressive candidate but the ticket became widely known as the bull moose party the election was mainly a contest between roosevelt and wilson taft receiving little attention and carrying just eight electoral voteswilson in a spirited campaign defeated both rivals under his leadership the new congress enacted one of the most notable legislative programs in american history its first task was tariff revision the tariff duties must be altered wilson said we must abolish everything that bears any semblance of privilege the underwood tariff in 1913 provided substantial rate reductions on imported raw materials and foodstuffs cotton and woolen goods iron and steel and removed the duties from more than a hundred other items although the act retained many protective features it was a genuine attempt to lower the cost of living for american workersthe second item on the democratic program was a reorganization of the banking and currency system control said wilson must be public not private must be vested in the government itself so that the banks may be the instruments not the masters of business and of individual enterprise and initiativepassage of the federal reserve act of 1913 was one of wilson's most enduring legislative accomplishments for he successfully negotiated a compromise between wall street and the agrarians the plan built on ideas developed by senator nelson aldrich who discovered the european nations had more efficient central banks that helped their internal business and international trade the new organization divided the country into 12 districts with a federal reserve bank in each all supervised by a federal reserve board these banks were owned by local banks and served as depositories for the cash reserves of member banks until the federal reserve act the us government had left control of its money supply largely to unregulated private banks while the official medium of exchange was gold coins most loans and payments were carried out with bank notes backed by the promise of redemption in gold the trouble with this system was that the banks were tempted to reach beyond their cash reserves prompting periodic panics during which fearful depositors raced to turn their bank paper into coin with the passage of the act greater flexibility in the money supply was assured and provision was made for issuing federal reserve notes—paper dollars—to meet business demands the fed opened in 1914 and played a central role in funding the world war after 1914 issues of money and banking faded away from the political agendato resolve the longstanding dispute over trusts the wilson administration dropped the trustbusting legal strategies of roosevelt and taft and relied on the new federal trade commission to issue orders prohibiting unfair methods of competition by business concerns in interstate trade in addition a second law the clayton antitrust act forbade many corporate practices that had thus far escaped specific condemnation—interlocking directorates price discrimination among purchasers use of the injunction in labor disputes and ownership by one corporation of stock in similar enterprises after 1914 the trust issue faded away from politicsthe adamson act of 1916 established an eighthour day for railroad labor and solidified the ties between the labor unions and the democratic party the record of achievement won wilson a firm place in american history as one of the nation's foremost liberal reformers wilson's domestic reputation would soon be overshadowed by his record as a wartime president who led his country to victory but could not hold the support of his people for the peace that followed

    question_text: reconstruction was the period from 1863 to 1877 in which the federal government temporarily took control—one by one—of the southern states of the confederacy before his assassination in april 1865 president abraham lincoln had announced moderate plans for reconstruction to reintegrate the former confederates as fast as possible lincoln set up the freedmen's bureau in march 1865 to aid former slaves in finding education health care and employment the final abolition of slavery was achieved by the thirteenth amendment ratified in december 1865 however lincoln was opposed by the radical republicans within his own party who feared that the former confederates would never truly give up on slavery and confederate nationalism and would always try to reinstate them behindthescenes as a result the radical republicans tried to impose legal restrictions that would strip most exrebels' rights to vote and hold elected office the radicals were opposed by lincoln's vice president and successor tennessee democrat andrew johnson however the radicals won the critical elections of 1866 winning enough seats in congress to override president johnson's vetoes of such legislation they even successfully impeached president johnson in the house of representatives and almost removed him from office in the senate in 1868 meanwhile they gave the south's freedmen new constitutional and federal legal protectionsthe radicals' reconstruction plans took effect in 1867 under the supervision of the us army allowing a republican coalition of freedmen scalawags sympathetic local whites and carpetbaggers recent arrivals from the north to take control of southern state governments they ratified the fourteenth amendment giving enormous new powers to the federal courts to deal with justice at the state level these state governments borrowed heavily to build railroads and public schools increasing taxation rates the backlash of increasingly fierce opposition to these policies drove most of the scalawags out of the republican party and into the democratic party president ulysses s grant enforced civil rights protections for africanamericans that were being challenged in south carolina mississippi and louisiana the fifteenth amendment was ratified in 1870 giving africanamericans the right to vote in american electionsus representative stevens was one of the major policymakers regarding reconstruction and obtained a house vote of impeachment against president andrew johnson hans trefousse his leading biographer concludes that stevens was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in congress he dominated the house with his wit knowledge of parliamentary law and sheer willpower even though he was often unable to prevailreconstruction ended at different times in each state the last in 1877 when republican rutherford b hayes won the contentious presidential election of 1876 over his opponent samuel j tilden to deal with disputed electoral votes congress set up an electoral commission it awarded the disputed votes to hayes the white south accepted the compromise of 1877 knowing that hayes proposed to end army control over the remaining three state governments in republican hands white northerners accepted that the civil war was over and that southern whites posed no threat to the nationthe end of reconstruction marked the end of the brief period of civil rights and civil liberties for african americans in the south where most lived reconstruction caused permanent resentment distrust and cynicism among white southerners toward the federal government and helped create the solid south which typically voted for the thensocially conservative democrats for all local state and national offices white supremacists created a segregated society through jim crow laws that made blacks secondclass citizens with very little political power or public voice the white elites called the redeemers—the southern wing of the bourbon democrats were in firm political and economic control of the south until the rise of the populist movement in the 1890s local law enforcement was weak in rural areas allowing outraged mobs to use lynching to redress allegedbutoftenunproven crimes charged to blackshistorians' interpretations of the radical republicans have dramatically shifted over the years from the pre1950 view of them as tools of big business motivated by partisanship and hatred of the white south to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slavesin the south itself the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s differed sharply by race americans often interpreted great events in religious terms historian wilson fallin contrasts the interpretation of civil war and reconstruction in white versus black using baptist sermons in alabama whites preachers expressed the view thatgod had chastised them and given them a special mission – to maintain orthodoxy strict bibnlicism personal piety and traditional race relations slavery they insisted had not been sinful rather emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of reconstruction was a clear sign of god's favorin sharp contrast black preachers interpreted the civil war emancipation and reconstruction asgod's gift of freedom they appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence to worship in their own way to affirm their worth and dignity and to proclaim the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man most of all they could form their own churches associations and conventions these institutions offered selfhelp and racial uplift and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed as a result black preachers continued to insist that god would protect and help him god would be there rock in a stormy landmost historians in the 21st century consider reconstruction to be a failure however historian mark summers in 2014 has argued thatif we see reconstruction's purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled of a union held together forever of a north and south able to work together of slavery extirpated and sectional rivalries confined of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty backed by armed force then reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was a lasting and unappreciated success

    question_text: the first major effort to organize workers' groups on a nationwide basis appeared with the noble order of the knights of labor in 1869 originally a secret ritualistic society organized by philadelphia garment workers it was open to all workers including african americans women and farmers the knights grew slowly until they succeeded in facing down the great railroad baron jay gould in an 1885 strike within a year they added 500000 workers to their rolls far more than the thin leadership structure of the knights could handlethe knights of labor soon fell into decline and their place in the labor movement was gradually taken by the american federation of labor afl rather than open its membership to all the afl under former cigarmakers union official samuel gompers focused on skilled workers his objectives were pure and simple increasing wages reducing hours and improving working conditions as such gompers helped turn the labor movement away from the socialist views earlier labor leaders had espoused the afl would gradually become a respected organization in the us although it would have nothing to do with unskilled laborersin times of economic depression layoffs and wage cuts angered the workers leading to violent labor conflicts in 1877 and 1894 in the great railroad strike in 1877 railroad workers across the nation went on strike in response to a 10percent pay cut attempts to break the strike led to bloody uprisings in several cities the haymarket riot took place in 1886 when an anarchist allegedly threw a bomb at police dispersing a strike rally at the mccormick harvesting machine company in chicago at its peak the knights claimed 700000 members by 1890 membership had plummeted to fewer than 100000 then faded away the killing of policemen greatly embarrassed the knights of labor which was not involved with the bomb but which took much of the blamein the riots of 1892 at carnegie's steel works in homestead pennsylvania a group of 300 pinkerton detectives whom the company had hired to break a bitter strike by the amalgamated association of iron steel and tin workers were fired upon by strikers and 10 were killed as a result the national guard was called in to guard the plant nonunion workers were hired and the strike broken the homestead plant completely barred unions until 1937two years later wage cuts at the pullman palace car company just outside chicago led to a strike which with the support of the american railway union soon brought the nation's railway industry to a halt the shutdown of rail traffic meant the virtual shutdown of the entire national economy and president grover cleveland acted vigorously he secured injunctions in federal court which eugene debs and the other strike leaders ignored cleveland then sent in the army to stop the rioting and get the trains moving the strike collapsed as did the aruthe most militant working class organization of the 1905–1920 era was the industrial workers of the world iww formed largely in response to abysmal labor conditions in 1904 the year before its founding 27000 workers were killed on the job and discrimination against women minorities and unskilled laborers by other unions particularly the afl the wobblies as they were commonly known gained particular prominence from their incendiary and revolutionary rhetoric openly calling for class warfare direct action workplace democracy and one big union for all workers regardless of sex race or skills the wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike commonly known as the bread and roses strike in lawrence massachusetts they proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away but according to historian howard zinn the iww became a threat to the capitalist class exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge the iww strongly opposed the 1917–18 war effort and faced a campaign of repression from the federal government more than a few wobblies such as frank little were beaten or lynched by mobs or died in american jails the union exists to this day and has been involved in various labor disputes throughout the 2000s

    question_text: by 1880 the granger movement began to decline and was replaced by the farmers' alliance from the beginning the farmers' alliance were political organizations with elaborate economic programs according to one early platform its purpose was to unite the farmers of america for their protection against class legislation and the encroachments of concentrated capital their program also called for the regulation—if not the outright nationalization—of the railroads currency inflation to provide debt relief the lowering of the tariff and the establishment of governmentowned storehouses and lowinterest lending facilities these were known as the ocala demandsduring the late 1880s a series of droughts devastated the west western kansas lost half its population during a fouryear span by 1890 the level of agrarian distress was at an alltime high mary elizabeth lease a noted populist writer and agitator told farmers that they needed to raise less corn and more hell working with sympathetic democrats in the south and small third parties in the west the farmer's alliance made a push for political power from these elements a new political party known as the populist party emerged the elections of 1890 brought the new party into coalitions that controlled parts of state government in a dozen southern and western states and sent a score of populist senators and representatives to congressits first convention was in 1892 when delegates from farm labor and reform organizations met in omaha nebraska determined at last to make their mark on a us political system that they viewed as hopelessly corrupted by the monied interests of the industrial and commercial truststhe pragmatic portion of the populist platform focused on issues of land railroads and money including the unlimited coinage of silver the populists showed impressive strength in the west and south in the 1892 elections and their candidate for president polled more than a million votes it was the currency question however pitting advocates of silver against those who favored gold that soon overshadowed all other issues agrarian spokesmen in the west and south demanded a return to the unlimited coinage of silver convinced that their troubles stemmed from a shortage of money in circulation they argued that increasing the volume of money would indirectly raise prices for farm products and drive up industrial wages thus allowing debts to be paid with inflated dollarsconservative groups and the financial classes on the other hand believed that such a policy would be disastrous and they insisted that inflation once begun could not be stopped railroad bonds the most important financial instrument of the time were payable in gold if fares and freight rates were set in halfprice silver dollars railroads would go bankrupt in weeks throwing hundreds of thousands of men out of work and destroying the industrial economy only the gold standard they said offered stabilitythe financial panic of 1893 heightened the tension of this debate bank failures abounded in the south and midwest unemployment soared and crop prices fell badly the crisis and president cleveland's inability to solve it nearly broke the democratic partythe democratic party which supported silver and free trade absorbed the remnants of the populist movement as the presidential elections of 1896 neared the democratic convention that year was witness to one of the most famous speeches in us political history pleading with the convention not to crucify mankind on a cross of gold william jennings bryan the young nebraskan champion of silver won the democrats' presidential nomination the remaining populists also endorsed bryan hoping to retain some influence by having a voice inside the bryan movement despite carrying the south and all the west except california and oregon bryan lost the more populated industrial north and east—and the election—to the republican william mckinley with his campaign slogan a full dinner pailin 1897 the economy began to improve mostly from restored business confidence silverites—who did not realize that most transactions were handled by bank checks not sacks of gold—believed the new prosperity was spurred by the discovery of gold in the yukon in 1898 the spanish–american war drew the nation's attention further away from populist issues if the movement was dead however its ideas were not once the populists supported an idea it became so tainted that the vast majority of american politicians rejected it only years later after the taint had been forgotten was it possible to achieve populist reforms such as the direct popular election of senators

    question_text: two years later woodrow wilson the democratic progressive governor of the state of new jersey campaigned against taft the republican candidate and against roosevelt who was appalled by his successor's policies and thus broke his earlier pledge to not run for a third term as the republicans would not nominate him he ran as a thirdparty progressive candidate but the ticket became widely known as the bull moose party the election was mainly a contest between roosevelt and wilson taft receiving little attention and carrying just eight electoral voteswilson in a spirited campaign defeated both rivals under his leadership the new congress enacted one of the most notable legislative programs in american history its first task was tariff revision the tariff duties must be altered wilson said we must abolish everything that bears any semblance of privilege the underwood tariff in 1913 provided substantial rate reductions on imported raw materials and foodstuffs cotton and woolen goods iron and steel and removed the duties from more than a hundred other items although the act retained many protective features it was a genuine attempt to lower the cost of living for american workersthe second item on the democratic program was a reorganization of the banking and currency system control said wilson must be public not private must be vested in the government itself so that the banks may be the instruments not the masters of business and of individual enterprise and initiativepassage of the federal reserve act of 1913 was one of wilson's most enduring legislative accomplishments for he successfully negotiated a compromise between wall street and the agrarians the plan built on ideas developed by senator nelson aldrich who discovered the european nations had more efficient central banks that helped their internal business and international trade the new organization divided the country into 12 districts with a federal reserve bank in each all supervised by a federal reserve board these banks were owned by local banks and served as depositories for the cash reserves of member banks until the federal reserve act the us government had left control of its money supply largely to unregulated private banks while the official medium of exchange was gold coins most loans and payments were carried out with bank notes backed by the promise of redemption in gold the trouble with this system was that the banks were tempted to reach beyond their cash reserves prompting periodic panics during which fearful depositors raced to turn their bank paper into coin with the passage of the act greater flexibility in the money supply was assured and provision was made for issuing federal reserve notes—paper dollars—to meet business demands the fed opened in 1914 and played a central role in funding the world war after 1914 issues of money and banking faded away from the political agendato resolve the longstanding dispute over trusts the wilson administration dropped the trustbusting legal strategies of roosevelt and taft and relied on the new federal trade commission to issue orders prohibiting unfair methods of competition by business concerns in interstate trade in addition a second law the clayton antitrust act forbade many corporate practices that had thus far escaped specific condemnation—interlocking directorates price discrimination among purchasers use of the injunction in labor disputes and ownership by one corporation of stock in similar enterprises after 1914 the trust issue faded away from politicsthe adamson act of 1916 established an eighthour day for railroad labor and solidified the ties between the labor unions and the democratic party the record of achievement won wilson a firm place in american history as one of the nation's foremost liberal reformers wilson's domestic reputation would soon be overshadowed by his record as a wartime president who led his country to victory but could not hold the support of his people for the peace that followed

    question_text: in 1953 stalin died and after the 1952 presidential election president dwight d eisenhower used the opportunity to end the korean war while continuing cold war policies secretary of state john foster dulles was the dominant figure in the nation's foreign policy in the 1950s dulles denounced the containment of the truman administration and espoused an active program of liberation which would lead to a rollback of communism the most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of massive retaliation which dulles announced early in 1954 eschewing the costly conventional ground forces characteristic of the truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the us nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence dulles defined this approach as brinkmanshipa dramatic shock to americans' selfconfidence and its technological superiority came in 1957 when the soviets beat the united states into outer space by launching sputnik the first earth satellite the space race began and by the early 1960s the united states had forged ahead with president kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s—the landing indeed took place on july 20 1969trouble close to home appeared when the soviets formed an alliance with cuba after fidel castro's successful revolution in 1959east germany was the weak point in the soviet empire with refugees leaving for the west by the thousands every week the soviet solution came in 1961 with the berlin wall to stop east germans from fleeing communism this was a major propaganda setback for the ussr but it did allow them to keep control of east berlinthe communist world split in half as china turned against the soviet union mao denounced khrushchev for going soft on capitalism however the us failed to take advantage of this split until president richard nixon saw the opportunity in 1969 in 1958 the us sent troops into lebanon for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war between 1954 and 1961 eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to south vietnam to stabilize the prowestern government under attack by insurgents eisenhower supported cia efforts to undermine antiamerican governments which proved most successful in iran and guatemalathe first major strain among the nato alliance occurred in 1956 when eisenhower forced britain and france to retreat from their invasion of egypt with israel which was intended to get back their ownership of the suez canal instead of supporting the claims of its nato partners the eisenhower administration stated that it opposed french and british imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence fearing that egyptian leader gamal abdel nasser's standoff with the region's old colonial powers would bolster soviet power in the regionthe cold war reached its most dangerous point during the kennedy administration in the cuban missile crisis a tense confrontation between the soviet union and the united states over the soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in cuba the crisis began on october 16 1962 and lasted for thirteen days it was the moment when the cold war was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations kennedy decided not to invade or bomb cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island the crisis ended in a compromise with the soviets removing their missiles publicly and the united states secretly removing its nuclear missiles in turkey in moscow communist leaders removed nikita khrushchev because of his reckless behavior

    question_text: wartime rationing was officially lifted in september 1945 but prosperity did not immediately return as the next three years would witness the difficult transition back to a peacetime economy 12 million returning veterans were in need of work and in many cases could not find it inflation became a rather serious problem averaging over 10 a year until 1950 and raw materials shortages dogged manufacturing industry in addition labor strikes rocked the nation in some cases exacerbated by racial tensions due to africanamericans having taken jobs during the war and now being faced with irate returning veterans who demanded that they step aside the huge number of women employed in the workforce in the war were also rapidly cleared out make room for their husbands following the republican takeover of congress in the 1946 elections president truman was compelled to reduce taxes and curb government interference in the economy with this done the stage was set for the economic boom that with only a few minor hiccups would last for the next 23 years after the initial hurdles of the 194548 period were overcome americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years the result was a mass consumer spending spree with a huge and voracious demand for new homes cars and housewares increasing numbers enjoyed high wages larger houses better schools more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners washing machines—which were all made for laborsaving and to make housework easier inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era the livein maid and cook common features of middleclass homes at the beginning of the century were virtually unheard of in the 1950s only the very rich had servants householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water new style furniture was bright cheap and light and easy to move around as noted by john kenneth galbraith in 1958the ordinary individual has access to amenities – foods entertainments personal transportation and plumbing – in which not even the rich rejoiced a century agoconsumerism represented one of the consequences as well as one of the key ingredients of the postwar economic boom the initial quest for cars appliances and new furniture after the end of world war ii quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods services and recreational materials during the fifties between 1945 and 1960 gnp grew by 250 expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times and consumption on personal services increased three times by 1960 per capita income was 35 higher than in 1945 and america had entered what the economist walt rostow referred to as the high mass consumption stage of economic development shortterm credit went up from 84 billion in 1946 to 456 billion in 1958 as a result of the postwar economic boom 60 of the american population had attained a middleclass standard of living by the mid50s defined as incomes of 3000 to 10000 in constant dollars compared with only 31 in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the great depression by the end of the decade 87 of families owned a tv set 75 a car and 75 a washing machine between 1947 and 1960 the average real income for american workers increased by as much as it had in the previous halfcenturywith the prosperity of the era the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science technology progress and futurism there was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before nonetheless the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals eg henry miller's books the airconditioned nightmare and sunday after the war and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of american society that would erupt during the following decadein addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items the united states became the world's factory as it was the only major power who's soil had been untouched by the war american money and manufactured goods flooded into europe south korea and japan and helped in their reconstruction us manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quartercentury after 1945one of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945 acquisition of technology from occupied germany also proved an asset as it was sometimes more advanced than its american counterpart especially in the optics and audio equipment fields the typical automobile in 1950 was an average of 300 more expensive than the 1940 version but also produced in twice the numbers luxury makes such as cadillac which had been largely handbuilt vehicles only available to the rich now became a massproduced car within the price range of the upper middleclassthe rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of america and the decline of smaller businesses which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated both due to the abovementioned factors and the event of tv news the railroad industry once one of the cornerstones of the american economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system by the end of the 1950s it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt necessitating a takeover by the federal government smaller automobile manufacturers such as nash studebaker and packard were unable to compete with the big three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next 15 years suburbanization caused the gradual movement of workingclass people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores in time this would have disastrous effects on urban areasprosperity and overall optimism made americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 the baby boom climaxed during the mid1950s after which birthrates gradually dropped off until going below replacement level in 1965 although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high averaging 23 they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era among other things this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children's products and a huge expansion of the public school system the large size of the postwar baby boom generation would have significant social repercussions in american society for decades to comeaside from the unfolding civil rights movement women had been forced out of factories at the end of wwii for returning veterans and many chafed at the social expectations of being an idle stayathome housewife who cooked cleaned shopped and tended to children alcohol and pill abuse was not uncommon among american women during the 1950s something quite contrary to the idyllic image presented in tv shows such as leave it to beaver the adventures of ozzie and harriet and father knows best in 1963 betty friedan publisher her book the feminine mystique which strongly criticized the role of women during the postwar years and was a bestseller and a major catalyst of the women's liberation movement sociologists have noted that the idle housewife of the 1950s was the exception in american history rather than the norm where women generally did work or labor in some capacityprosperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past this had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rockandroll as well as fashion styles and subcultures the most famous of which was the greaser a young male who drove motorcycles sported ducktail haircuts which were widely banned in schools and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority the greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youthoriented movies blackboard jungle 1953 starring marlon brando and rebel without a cause 1955 starring james deanthe american economy grew dramatically in the postwar period expanding at a rate of 35 per annum between 1945 and 1970 during this period of prosperity many incomes doubled in a generation described by economist frank levy as upward mobility on a rocket ship the substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy as noted by deone zell assembly line work paid well while unionized factory jobs served as steppingstones to the middle class by the end of the fifties 87 of all american families owned at least one tv 75 owned cars and 60 owned their homes by 1960 bluecollar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services in addition by the early 1970s postworld war ii american consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other countrythe great majority of american workers who had stable jobs were well off financially while even nonunion jobs were associated with rising paychecks benefits and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work an upscale working class came into being as american bluecollar workers came to enjoy the benefits of home ownership while high wages provided bluecollar workers with the ability to pay for new cars household appliances and regular vacations by the 1960s a bluecollar worker earned more than a manager did in the 1940s despite the fact that his relative position within the income distribution had not changedas noted by the historian nancy wierekin the postwar period the majority of americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted desired or chose to have rather than on necessities aloneas argued by the historians ronald edsforth and larry bennettby the mid1960's the majority of america's organized working class who were not victims of the second red scare embraced or at least tolerated anticommunism because it was an integral part of the new american dream to which they had committed their lives theirs was not an unobtainable dream nor were their lives empty because of it indeed for at least a quarter of century the material promises of consumeroriented americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in american historybetween 1946 and 1960 the united states witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services gnp rose by 36 and personal consumption expenditures by 42 cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals while the number of these units rose sharply from 433 million to 561 million in 1960 a rise of almost 23 their average incomes grew even faster from 3940 in 1946 to 6900 in 1960 an increase of 43 after taking inflation into account the real advance was 16 the dramatic rise in the average american standard of living was such that according to sociologist george katonatoday in this country minimum standards of nutrition housing and clothing are assured not for all but for the majority beyond these minimum needs such former luxuries as homeownership durable goods travel recreation and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few the broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for themmore than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960 and in the latter year 52 of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes in 1957 out of all the wired homes throughout the country 96 had a refrigerator 87 an electric washer 81 a television 67 a vacuum cleaner 18 a freezer 12 an electric or gas dryer and 8 air conditioning car ownership also soared with 72 of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960 from 1958 to 1964 the average weekly takehome pay of bluecollar workers rose steadily from 68 to 78 in constant dollars in a poll taken in 1949 50 of all americans said that they were satisfied with their family income a figure that rose to 67 by 1969the period from 1946 to 1960 also witnessed a significant increase in the paid leisure time of working people the fortyhour workweek established by the fair labor standards act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960 while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the selfemployed worked less hours than they had done previously although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers with 91 of bluecollar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 usually to a maximum of three weeks while by the early sixties virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960 while many bluecollar and whitecollar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year tuition was kept low—it was free at california state universities at the advanced level american science engineering and medicine was world famous by the midsixties the majority of american workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world and by the late sixties the great majority of americans were richer than people in other countries except sweden switzerland and canada educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world as noted by the historian john vaizeyto strike a balance with the soviet union it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest americans were better off than the russians that education was better but the health service worse but that above all the americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutionsin regards to social welfare the postwar era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness as private insurance programs like blue cross and blue shield expanded with the exception of farm and domestic workers virtually all members of the labor force were covered by social security in 1959 that about twothirds of the factory workers and threefourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans in addition 86 of factory workers and 83 of office had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59 and 61 had additional insurance for doctors by 1969 the average white family income had risen to 10953 while average black family income lagged behind at 7255 revealing a continued racial disparity in income amongst various segments of the american population the percentage of american students staying on in education after the age of 15 was also higher than in most other developed countries with more than 90 of 16yearolds and around 75 of 17yearolds in education in 196466at the center of middleclass culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods a result of the postwar prosperity the increase in variety and availability of consumer products and television advertising america generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles clothing appliances family vacations and higher education

    question_text: although they had white supporters and sympathizers the civil rights movement was designed led organized and manned by african americans who placed themselves and their families on the front lines in the struggle for freedom their heroism was brought home to every american through newspaper and later television reports as their peaceful marches and demonstrations were violently attacked by law enforcement officers used batons bullwhips fire hoses police dogs and mass arrests to intimidate the protesters the second characteristic of the movement is that it was not monolithic led by one or two men rather it was a dispersed grassroots campaign that attacked segregation in many different places using many different tactics while some groups and individuals within the civil rights movement—such as malcolm x—advocated black power black separatism or even armed resistance the majority of participants remained committed to the principles of nonviolence a deliberate decision by an oppressed minority to abstain from violence for political gain using nonviolent strategies civil rights activists took advantage of emerging national networknews reporting especially television to capture national attentionthe leadership role of black churches in the movement was a natural extension of their structure and function they offered members an opportunity to exercise roles denied them in society throughout history the black church served as a place of worship and also as a base for powerful ministers such as congressman adam clayton powell in new york city the most prominent clergyman in the civil rights movement was martin luther king jr time magazine's 1963 man of the year showed tireless personal commitment to black freedom and his strong leadership won him worldwide acclaim and the nobel peace prizestudents and seminarians in both the south and the north played key roles in every phase of the movement church and studentled movements such as the nashville student movement developed their own organizational and sustaining structures the southern christian leadership conference sclc founded in 1957 coordinated and raised funds mostly from northern sources for local protests and for the training of black leaders the student nonviolent coordinating committee or sncc founded in 1957 developed the jailnobail strategy sncc's role was to develop and link sitin campaigns and to help organize freedom rides voter registration drives and other protest activities these three new groups often joined forces with existing organizations such as the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp founded in 1909 the congress of racial equality core founded in 1942 and the national urban league the naacp and its director roy wilkins provided legal counsel for jailed demonstrators helped raise bail and continued to test segregation and discrimination in the courts as it had been doing for half a century core initiated the 1961 freedom rides which involved many sncc members and core's leader james farmer later became executive secretary of sncc the administration of president john f kennedy supported enforcement of desegregation in schools and public facilities attorney general robert kennedy brought more than 50 lawsuits in four states to secure black americans' right to vote however fbi director j edgar hoover concerned about possible communist influence in the civil rights movement and personally antagonistic to king used the fbi to discredit king and other civil rights leaders

    question_text: in 1953 stalin died and after the 1952 presidential election president dwight d eisenhower used the opportunity to end the korean war while continuing cold war policies secretary of state john foster dulles was the dominant figure in the nation's foreign policy in the 1950s dulles denounced the containment of the truman administration and espoused an active program of liberation which would lead to a rollback of communism the most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of massive retaliation which dulles announced early in 1954 eschewing the costly conventional ground forces characteristic of the truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the us nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence dulles defined this approach as brinkmanshipa dramatic shock to americans' selfconfidence and its technological superiority came in 1957 when the soviets beat the united states into outer space by launching sputnik the first earth satellite the space race began and by the early 1960s the united states had forged ahead with president kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s—the landing indeed took place on july 20 1969trouble close to home appeared when the soviets formed an alliance with cuba after fidel castro's successful revolution in 1959east germany was the weak point in the soviet empire with refugees leaving for the west by the thousands every week the soviet solution came in 1961 with the berlin wall to stop east germans from fleeing communism this was a major propaganda setback for the ussr but it did allow them to keep control of east berlinthe communist world split in half as china turned against the soviet union mao denounced khrushchev for going soft on capitalism however the us failed to take advantage of this split until president richard nixon saw the opportunity in 1969 in 1958 the us sent troops into lebanon for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war between 1954 and 1961 eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to south vietnam to stabilize the prowestern government under attack by insurgents eisenhower supported cia efforts to undermine antiamerican governments which proved most successful in iran and guatemalathe first major strain among the nato alliance occurred in 1956 when eisenhower forced britain and france to retreat from their invasion of egypt with israel which was intended to get back their ownership of the suez canal instead of supporting the claims of its nato partners the eisenhower administration stated that it opposed french and british imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence fearing that egyptian leader gamal abdel nasser's standoff with the region's old colonial powers would bolster soviet power in the regionthe cold war reached its most dangerous point during the kennedy administration in the cuban missile crisis a tense confrontation between the soviet union and the united states over the soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in cuba the crisis began on october 16 1962 and lasted for thirteen days it was the moment when the cold war was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations kennedy decided not to invade or bomb cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island the crisis ended in a compromise with the soviets removing their missiles publicly and the united states secretly removing its nuclear missiles in turkey in moscow communist leaders removed nikita khrushchev because of his reckless behavior

    question_text: wartime rationing was officially lifted in september 1945 but prosperity did not immediately return as the next three years would witness the difficult transition back to a peacetime economy 12 million returning veterans were in need of work and in many cases could not find it inflation became a rather serious problem averaging over 10 a year until 1950 and raw materials shortages dogged manufacturing industry in addition labor strikes rocked the nation in some cases exacerbated by racial tensions due to africanamericans having taken jobs during the war and now being faced with irate returning veterans who demanded that they step aside the huge number of women employed in the workforce in the war were also rapidly cleared out make room for their husbands following the republican takeover of congress in the 1946 elections president truman was compelled to reduce taxes and curb government interference in the economy with this done the stage was set for the economic boom that with only a few minor hiccups would last for the next 23 years after the initial hurdles of the 194548 period were overcome americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years the result was a mass consumer spending spree with a huge and voracious demand for new homes cars and housewares increasing numbers enjoyed high wages larger houses better schools more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners washing machines—which were all made for laborsaving and to make housework easier inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era the livein maid and cook common features of middleclass homes at the beginning of the century were virtually unheard of in the 1950s only the very rich had servants householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water new style furniture was bright cheap and light and easy to move around as noted by john kenneth galbraith in 1958the ordinary individual has access to amenities – foods entertainments personal transportation and plumbing – in which not even the rich rejoiced a century agoconsumerism represented one of the consequences as well as one of the key ingredients of the postwar economic boom the initial quest for cars appliances and new furniture after the end of world war ii quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods services and recreational materials during the fifties between 1945 and 1960 gnp grew by 250 expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times and consumption on personal services increased three times by 1960 per capita income was 35 higher than in 1945 and america had entered what the economist walt rostow referred to as the high mass consumption stage of economic development shortterm credit went up from 84 billion in 1946 to 456 billion in 1958 as a result of the postwar economic boom 60 of the american population had attained a middleclass standard of living by the mid50s defined as incomes of 3000 to 10000 in constant dollars compared with only 31 in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the great depression by the end of the decade 87 of families owned a tv set 75 a car and 75 a washing machine between 1947 and 1960 the average real income for american workers increased by as much as it had in the previous halfcenturywith the prosperity of the era the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science technology progress and futurism there was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before nonetheless the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals eg henry miller's books the airconditioned nightmare and sunday after the war and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of american society that would erupt during the following decadein addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items the united states became the world's factory as it was the only major power who's soil had been untouched by the war american money and manufactured goods flooded into europe south korea and japan and helped in their reconstruction us manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quartercentury after 1945one of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945 acquisition of technology from occupied germany also proved an asset as it was sometimes more advanced than its american counterpart especially in the optics and audio equipment fields the typical automobile in 1950 was an average of 300 more expensive than the 1940 version but also produced in twice the numbers luxury makes such as cadillac which had been largely handbuilt vehicles only available to the rich now became a massproduced car within the price range of the upper middleclassthe rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of america and the decline of smaller businesses which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated both due to the abovementioned factors and the event of tv news the railroad industry once one of the cornerstones of the american economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system by the end of the 1950s it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt necessitating a takeover by the federal government smaller automobile manufacturers such as nash studebaker and packard were unable to compete with the big three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next 15 years suburbanization caused the gradual movement of workingclass people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores in time this would have disastrous effects on urban areasprosperity and overall optimism made americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 the baby boom climaxed during the mid1950s after which birthrates gradually dropped off until going below replacement level in 1965 although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high averaging 23 they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era among other things this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children's products and a huge expansion of the public school system the large size of the postwar baby boom generation would have significant social repercussions in american society for decades to comeaside from the unfolding civil rights movement women had been forced out of factories at the end of wwii for returning veterans and many chafed at the social expectations of being an idle stayathome housewife who cooked cleaned shopped and tended to children alcohol and pill abuse was not uncommon among american women during the 1950s something quite contrary to the idyllic image presented in tv shows such as leave it to beaver the adventures of ozzie and harriet and father knows best in 1963 betty friedan publisher her book the feminine mystique which strongly criticized the role of women during the postwar years and was a bestseller and a major catalyst of the women's liberation movement sociologists have noted that the idle housewife of the 1950s was the exception in american history rather than the norm where women generally did work or labor in some capacityprosperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past this had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rockandroll as well as fashion styles and subcultures the most famous of which was the greaser a young male who drove motorcycles sported ducktail haircuts which were widely banned in schools and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority the greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youthoriented movies blackboard jungle 1953 starring marlon brando and rebel without a cause 1955 starring james deanthe american economy grew dramatically in the postwar period expanding at a rate of 35 per annum between 1945 and 1970 during this period of prosperity many incomes doubled in a generation described by economist frank levy as upward mobility on a rocket ship the substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy as noted by deone zell assembly line work paid well while unionized factory jobs served as steppingstones to the middle class by the end of the fifties 87 of all american families owned at least one tv 75 owned cars and 60 owned their homes by 1960 bluecollar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services in addition by the early 1970s postworld war ii american consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other countrythe great majority of american workers who had stable jobs were well off financially while even nonunion jobs were associated with rising paychecks benefits and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work an upscale working class came into being as american bluecollar workers came to enjoy the benefits of home ownership while high wages provided bluecollar workers with the ability to pay for new cars household appliances and regular vacations by the 1960s a bluecollar worker earned more than a manager did in the 1940s despite the fact that his relative position within the income distribution had not changedas noted by the historian nancy wierekin the postwar period the majority of americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted desired or chose to have rather than on necessities aloneas argued by the historians ronald edsforth and larry bennettby the mid1960's the majority of america's organized working class who were not victims of the second red scare embraced or at least tolerated anticommunism because it was an integral part of the new american dream to which they had committed their lives theirs was not an unobtainable dream nor were their lives empty because of it indeed for at least a quarter of century the material promises of consumeroriented americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in american historybetween 1946 and 1960 the united states witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services gnp rose by 36 and personal consumption expenditures by 42 cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals while the number of these units rose sharply from 433 million to 561 million in 1960 a rise of almost 23 their average incomes grew even faster from 3940 in 1946 to 6900 in 1960 an increase of 43 after taking inflation into account the real advance was 16 the dramatic rise in the average american standard of living was such that according to sociologist george katonatoday in this country minimum standards of nutrition housing and clothing are assured not for all but for the majority beyond these minimum needs such former luxuries as homeownership durable goods travel recreation and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few the broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for themmore than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960 and in the latter year 52 of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes in 1957 out of all the wired homes throughout the country 96 had a refrigerator 87 an electric washer 81 a television 67 a vacuum cleaner 18 a freezer 12 an electric or gas dryer and 8 air conditioning car ownership also soared with 72 of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960 from 1958 to 1964 the average weekly takehome pay of bluecollar workers rose steadily from 68 to 78 in constant dollars in a poll taken in 1949 50 of all americans said that they were satisfied with their family income a figure that rose to 67 by 1969the period from 1946 to 1960 also witnessed a significant increase in the paid leisure time of working people the fortyhour workweek established by the fair labor standards act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960 while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the selfemployed worked less hours than they had done previously although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers with 91 of bluecollar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 usually to a maximum of three weeks while by the early sixties virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960 while many bluecollar and whitecollar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year tuition was kept low—it was free at california state universities at the advanced level american science engineering and medicine was world famous by the midsixties the majority of american workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world and by the late sixties the great majority of americans were richer than people in other countries except sweden switzerland and canada educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world as noted by the historian john vaizeyto strike a balance with the soviet union it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest americans were better off than the russians that education was better but the health service worse but that above all the americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutionsin regards to social welfare the postwar era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness as private insurance programs like blue cross and blue shield expanded with the exception of farm and domestic workers virtually all members of the labor force were covered by social security in 1959 that about twothirds of the factory workers and threefourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans in addition 86 of factory workers and 83 of office had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59 and 61 had additional insurance for doctors by 1969 the average white family income had risen to 10953 while average black family income lagged behind at 7255 revealing a continued racial disparity in income amongst various segments of the american population the percentage of american students staying on in education after the age of 15 was also higher than in most other developed countries with more than 90 of 16yearolds and around 75 of 17yearolds in education in 196466at the center of middleclass culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods a result of the postwar prosperity the increase in variety and availability of consumer products and television advertising america generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles clothing appliances family vacations and higher education

    question_text: in 1953 stalin died and after the 1952 presidential election president dwight d eisenhower used the opportunity to end the korean war while continuing cold war policies secretary of state john foster dulles was the dominant figure in the nation's foreign policy in the 1950s dulles denounced the containment of the truman administration and espoused an active program of liberation which would lead to a rollback of communism the most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of massive retaliation which dulles announced early in 1954 eschewing the costly conventional ground forces characteristic of the truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the us nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence dulles defined this approach as brinkmanshipa dramatic shock to americans' selfconfidence and its technological superiority came in 1957 when the soviets beat the united states into outer space by launching sputnik the first earth satellite the space race began and by the early 1960s the united states had forged ahead with president kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s—the landing indeed took place on july 20 1969trouble close to home appeared when the soviets formed an alliance with cuba after fidel castro's successful revolution in 1959east germany was the weak point in the soviet empire with refugees leaving for the west by the thousands every week the soviet solution came in 1961 with the berlin wall to stop east germans from fleeing communism this was a major propaganda setback for the ussr but it did allow them to keep control of east berlinthe communist world split in half as china turned against the soviet union mao denounced khrushchev for going soft on capitalism however the us failed to take advantage of this split until president richard nixon saw the opportunity in 1969 in 1958 the us sent troops into lebanon for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war between 1954 and 1961 eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to south vietnam to stabilize the prowestern government under attack by insurgents eisenhower supported cia efforts to undermine antiamerican governments which proved most successful in iran and guatemalathe first major strain among the nato alliance occurred in 1956 when eisenhower forced britain and france to retreat from their invasion of egypt with israel which was intended to get back their ownership of the suez canal instead of supporting the claims of its nato partners the eisenhower administration stated that it opposed french and british imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence fearing that egyptian leader gamal abdel nasser's standoff with the region's old colonial powers would bolster soviet power in the regionthe cold war reached its most dangerous point during the kennedy administration in the cuban missile crisis a tense confrontation between the soviet union and the united states over the soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in cuba the crisis began on october 16 1962 and lasted for thirteen days it was the moment when the cold war was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations kennedy decided not to invade or bomb cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island the crisis ended in a compromise with the soviets removing their missiles publicly and the united states secretly removing its nuclear missiles in turkey in moscow communist leaders removed nikita khrushchev because of his reckless behavior

    question_text: wartime rationing was officially lifted in september 1945 but prosperity did not immediately return as the next three years would witness the difficult transition back to a peacetime economy 12 million returning veterans were in need of work and in many cases could not find it inflation became a rather serious problem averaging over 10 a year until 1950 and raw materials shortages dogged manufacturing industry in addition labor strikes rocked the nation in some cases exacerbated by racial tensions due to africanamericans having taken jobs during the war and now being faced with irate returning veterans who demanded that they step aside the huge number of women employed in the workforce in the war were also rapidly cleared out make room for their husbands following the republican takeover of congress in the 1946 elections president truman was compelled to reduce taxes and curb government interference in the economy with this done the stage was set for the economic boom that with only a few minor hiccups would last for the next 23 years after the initial hurdles of the 194548 period were overcome americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years the result was a mass consumer spending spree with a huge and voracious demand for new homes cars and housewares increasing numbers enjoyed high wages larger houses better schools more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners washing machines—which were all made for laborsaving and to make housework easier inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era the livein maid and cook common features of middleclass homes at the beginning of the century were virtually unheard of in the 1950s only the very rich had servants householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water new style furniture was bright cheap and light and easy to move around as noted by john kenneth galbraith in 1958the ordinary individual has access to amenities – foods entertainments personal transportation and plumbing – in which not even the rich rejoiced a century agoconsumerism represented one of the consequences as well as one of the key ingredients of the postwar economic boom the initial quest for cars appliances and new furniture after the end of world war ii quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods services and recreational materials during the fifties between 1945 and 1960 gnp grew by 250 expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times and consumption on personal services increased three times by 1960 per capita income was 35 higher than in 1945 and america had entered what the economist walt rostow referred to as the high mass consumption stage of economic development shortterm credit went up from 84 billion in 1946 to 456 billion in 1958 as a result of the postwar economic boom 60 of the american population had attained a middleclass standard of living by the mid50s defined as incomes of 3000 to 10000 in constant dollars compared with only 31 in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the great depression by the end of the decade 87 of families owned a tv set 75 a car and 75 a washing machine between 1947 and 1960 the average real income for american workers increased by as much as it had in the previous halfcenturywith the prosperity of the era the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science technology progress and futurism there was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before nonetheless the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals eg henry miller's books the airconditioned nightmare and sunday after the war and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of american society that would erupt during the following decadein addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items the united states became the world's factory as it was the only major power who's soil had been untouched by the war american money and manufactured goods flooded into europe south korea and japan and helped in their reconstruction us manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quartercentury after 1945one of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945 acquisition of technology from occupied germany also proved an asset as it was sometimes more advanced than its american counterpart especially in the optics and audio equipment fields the typical automobile in 1950 was an average of 300 more expensive than the 1940 version but also produced in twice the numbers luxury makes such as cadillac which had been largely handbuilt vehicles only available to the rich now became a massproduced car within the price range of the upper middleclassthe rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of america and the decline of smaller businesses which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated both due to the abovementioned factors and the event of tv news the railroad industry once one of the cornerstones of the american economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system by the end of the 1950s it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt necessitating a takeover by the federal government smaller automobile manufacturers such as nash studebaker and packard were unable to compete with the big three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next 15 years suburbanization caused the gradual movement of workingclass people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores in time this would have disastrous effects on urban areasprosperity and overall optimism made americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 the baby boom climaxed during the mid1950s after which birthrates gradually dropped off until going below replacement level in 1965 although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high averaging 23 they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era among other things this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children's products and a huge expansion of the public school system the large size of the postwar baby boom generation would have significant social repercussions in american society for decades to comeaside from the unfolding civil rights movement women had been forced out of factories at the end of wwii for returning veterans and many chafed at the social expectations of being an idle stayathome housewife who cooked cleaned shopped and tended to children alcohol and pill abuse was not uncommon among american women during the 1950s something quite contrary to the idyllic image presented in tv shows such as leave it to beaver the adventures of ozzie and harriet and father knows best in 1963 betty friedan publisher her book the feminine mystique which strongly criticized the role of women during the postwar years and was a bestseller and a major catalyst of the women's liberation movement sociologists have noted that the idle housewife of the 1950s was the exception in american history rather than the norm where women generally did work or labor in some capacityprosperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past this had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rockandroll as well as fashion styles and subcultures the most famous of which was the greaser a young male who drove motorcycles sported ducktail haircuts which were widely banned in schools and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority the greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youthoriented movies blackboard jungle 1953 starring marlon brando and rebel without a cause 1955 starring james deanthe american economy grew dramatically in the postwar period expanding at a rate of 35 per annum between 1945 and 1970 during this period of prosperity many incomes doubled in a generation described by economist frank levy as upward mobility on a rocket ship the substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy as noted by deone zell assembly line work paid well while unionized factory jobs served as steppingstones to the middle class by the end of the fifties 87 of all american families owned at least one tv 75 owned cars and 60 owned their homes by 1960 bluecollar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services in addition by the early 1970s postworld war ii american consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other countrythe great majority of american workers who had stable jobs were well off financially while even nonunion jobs were associated with rising paychecks benefits and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work an upscale working class came into being as american bluecollar workers came to enjoy the benefits of home ownership while high wages provided bluecollar workers with the ability to pay for new cars household appliances and regular vacations by the 1960s a bluecollar worker earned more than a manager did in the 1940s despite the fact that his relative position within the income distribution had not changedas noted by the historian nancy wierekin the postwar period the majority of americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted desired or chose to have rather than on necessities aloneas argued by the historians ronald edsforth and larry bennettby the mid1960's the majority of america's organized working class who were not victims of the second red scare embraced or at least tolerated anticommunism because it was an integral part of the new american dream to which they had committed their lives theirs was not an unobtainable dream nor were their lives empty because of it indeed for at least a quarter of century the material promises of consumeroriented americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in american historybetween 1946 and 1960 the united states witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services gnp rose by 36 and personal consumption expenditures by 42 cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals while the number of these units rose sharply from 433 million to 561 million in 1960 a rise of almost 23 their average incomes grew even faster from 3940 in 1946 to 6900 in 1960 an increase of 43 after taking inflation into account the real advance was 16 the dramatic rise in the average american standard of living was such that according to sociologist george katonatoday in this country minimum standards of nutrition housing and clothing are assured not for all but for the majority beyond these minimum needs such former luxuries as homeownership durable goods travel recreation and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few the broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for themmore than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960 and in the latter year 52 of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes in 1957 out of all the wired homes throughout the country 96 had a refrigerator 87 an electric washer 81 a television 67 a vacuum cleaner 18 a freezer 12 an electric or gas dryer and 8 air conditioning car ownership also soared with 72 of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960 from 1958 to 1964 the average weekly takehome pay of bluecollar workers rose steadily from 68 to 78 in constant dollars in a poll taken in 1949 50 of all americans said that they were satisfied with their family income a figure that rose to 67 by 1969the period from 1946 to 1960 also witnessed a significant increase in the paid leisure time of working people the fortyhour workweek established by the fair labor standards act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960 while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the selfemployed worked less hours than they had done previously although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers with 91 of bluecollar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 usually to a maximum of three weeks while by the early sixties virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960 while many bluecollar and whitecollar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year tuition was kept low—it was free at california state universities at the advanced level american science engineering and medicine was world famous by the midsixties the majority of american workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world and by the late sixties the great majority of americans were richer than people in other countries except sweden switzerland and canada educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world as noted by the historian john vaizeyto strike a balance with the soviet union it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest americans were better off than the russians that education was better but the health service worse but that above all the americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutionsin regards to social welfare the postwar era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness as private insurance programs like blue cross and blue shield expanded with the exception of farm and domestic workers virtually all members of the labor force were covered by social security in 1959 that about twothirds of the factory workers and threefourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans in addition 86 of factory workers and 83 of office had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59 and 61 had additional insurance for doctors by 1969 the average white family income had risen to 10953 while average black family income lagged behind at 7255 revealing a continued racial disparity in income amongst various segments of the american population the percentage of american students staying on in education after the age of 15 was also higher than in most other developed countries with more than 90 of 16yearolds and around 75 of 17yearolds in education in 196466at the center of middleclass culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods a result of the postwar prosperity the increase in variety and availability of consumer products and television advertising america generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles clothing appliances family vacations and higher education

state shootings the nation's higher education system especially the elite schools virtually shut downthe nixon administration seized on student demonstrations to mobilize a conservative majority consisting of middleclass suburbanites and workingclass whites critical of radical extremists economics also played a role in this mobilization as a result of the vietnam war and lyndon johnson's failure to raise taxes to pay for it inflation shot up and real incomes declined many lower middleclass whites were critical of federal programs targeted towards blacks and the poor with one observer noting that their wages were often only “a notch or so above the welfare payments of liberal states” and yet “they are excluded from social programs targeted at the disadvantaged” numerous articles published at that time focused on the feelings of discontent that existed amongst many americansalthough middleincome americans benefited from great society initiatives that also benefited lowincome americans such as medicare and federal aid to education and despite the fact that statistics indicated that blacks and the poor with the two groups often treated as one lived an immeasurably more painful existence than lower middleclass whites there existed a widespread feeling that slum residents and ghetto residents were now in the driver’s seat a poll taken by newsweek in 1969 found that a plurality of middle americans believed that blacks had a better chance of getting adequate schooling a decent home and a good job in that same poll 85 believed that black militants were let off too easily 84 that campus demonstrators were treated too leniently and 79 that most people receiving welfare could help themselves analysts traced sentiments such as these to the economic insecurity of those dubbed the “middle americans” those earning between 5000 and 15000 a year and including many white ethnics who were 55 of the american population most of these middle americans were bluecollar workers whitecollar employees school teachers and lowerechelon bureaucrats although not poor according to william h chafe they suffered from many of the tensions of marginal prosperity such as indebtness inflation and the fear of losing what they had worked so hard to attain from 1956 to 1966 income had increased by 86 while the cost of borrowing had gone up even more by 113 many families were hard pressed to hold on to their “middleclass” status particularly at a time when rising inflation brought an end to increases in real income struggling to get by many middle americans viewed antipoverty expenditures and black demands as representing a threat to their own wellbeingirregular employment was also a problem with 20 of workers in 1969 unemployed for some period of time a figure that rose to 23 in 1970 many people also had little or no savings by the end of the sixties with a fifth of the population in 1969 having no liquid assets and nearly half the population having less than 500by the end of 1967 as noted by william h chafe‘the shrill attacks on “establishment” values from the left were matched by an equally vociferous defense of traditional values by those who were proud of all their society had achieved if feminists blacks antiwar demonstrators and advocates for the poor attacked the status quo with uncompromising vehemence millions of other americans rallied around the flag and made clear their intent to uphold the lifestyle and values to which they had devoted their lives significantly pollsters richard scammon and ben watterburg pointed out the protesters still represented only a small minority of the country the great majority of americans were “unyoung unpoor and unblack they are middleaged middle class and middle minded” it was not a scenario from which dissidents could take much comfort’riding on high approval ratings nixon was reelected in 1972 soundly defeating the liberal antiwar george mcgovern at the same time nixon became a lightning rod for much public hostility regarding the war in vietnam the morality of conflict continued to be an issue and incidents such as the my lai massacre further eroded support for the war and increased efforts of vietnamizationthe growing watergate scandal was a major disaster for nixon eroding his political support in public opinion and in washington however he did manage to secure largescale funding for south vietnam much of which was wasted the united states withdrew its troops from vietnam before the paris peace accords in 1973 in 1975 north vietnam invaded with conventional army forces and quickly conquered the south the us was not involved in the fighting in 1975 but did evacuate many vietnamese later nearly one million managed to flee to the us as refugees the impact on the us was muted with few political recriminations but it did leave a vietnam syndrome that cautioned against further military interventions anywhere else nixon and his next two successors ford and carter had dropped the containment policy and were not willing to intervene anywhere

    question_text: at the same time that president johnson persuaded congress to accept a tax cut in 1964 he was rapidly increasing spending for both domestic programs and for the war in vietnam the result was a major expansion of the money supply resting largely on government deficits which pushed prices rapidly upward however inflation also rested on the nation's steadily declining supremacy in international trade and moreover the decline in the global economic geopolitical commercial technological and cultural preponderance of the united states since the end of world war ii after 1945 the us enjoyed easy access to raw materials and substantial markets for its goods abroad the us was responsible for around a third of the world's industrial output because of the devastation of postwar europe by the 1960s not only were the industrialized nations now competing for increasingly scarce raw commodities but third world suppliers were increasingly demanding higher prices the automobile steel and electronics industries were also beginning to face stiff competition in the us domestic market by foreign producers who had more modern factories and higherquality productsinflation had been an extremely gentle 3 a year from 1949 to 1969 but as the 70s unfolded this began to change and the cost of energy and consumer products began to steadily climb in addition to the increased manufacturing competition from europe and japan the us faced other difficulties due to the general complacency that set in during the years of prosperity many americans assumed the good times would last forever and there was little attempt at investing in infrastructure and modernized manufacturing outside of the defense and aerospace sectors the boundless optimism and belief in science and progress that characterized the 1950s60s quickly eroded and gave way to a general cynicism and distrust of technology among americans fueled by growing concern over the negative effects on the environment by air and water pollution from automobiles and manufacturing especially events such as the cuyahoga river fire in cleveland ohio in 1969 and the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979 nixon promised to tackle sluggish growth and inflation known as stagflation through higher taxes and lower spending this met stiff resistance in congress as a result nixon changed course and opted to control the currency his appointees to the federal reserve sought a contraction of the money supply through higher interest rates but to little avail the tight money policy did little to curb inflation the cost of living rose a cumulative 15 during nixon's first two years in officeby the summer of 1971 nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to reverse the economic tide on august 15 1971 he ended the convertibility of the us dollar into gold which meant the demise of the bretton woods system in place since world war ii as a result the us dollar fell in world markets the devaluation helped stimulate american exports but it also made the purchase of vital inputs raw materials and finished goods from abroad more expensive also on august 15 1971 under the provisions of the economic stabilization act of 1970 nixon implemented phase i of his economic plan a ninetyday freeze on all wages and prices above their existing levels in november phase ii entailed mandatory guidelines for wage and price increases to be issued by a federal agency inflation subsided temporarily but the recession continued with rising unemployment to combat the recession nixon reversed course and adopted an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in phase iii the strict wage and price controls were lifted as a result inflation resumed its upward spiralinflationary pressures led to key shifts in economic policies following the great depression of the 1930s recessions—periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment—were viewed as the greatest of economic threats which could be counteracted by heavy government spending or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more in the 1970s major price increases particularly for energy created a strong fear of inflation as a result government leaders concentrated more on controlling inflation than on combating recession by limiting spending resisting tax cuts and reining in growth in the money supply the erratic economic programs of the nixon administration were indicative of a broader national confusion about the prospects for future american prosperity with little understanding of the international forces creating the economic problems nixon american economists and the public focused on immediate issues and shortterm solutions these underlying problems set the stage for conservative reaction a more aggressive foreign policy and a retreat from welfarebased solutions for minorities and the poor that would characterize the subsequent decades

    question_text: a new consciousness of the inequality of american women began sweeping the nation starting with the 1963 publication of betty friedan's bestseller the feminine mystique which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled assaulted american culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives mothers and keepers of the home and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job in 1966 friedan and others established the national organization for women or now to act as an naacp for womenprotests began and the new women's liberation movement grew in size and power gained much media attention and by 1968 had replaced the civil rights movement as the us's main social revolution marches parades rallies boycotts and pickets brought out thousands sometimes millions friedan's women's strike for equality 1970 was a nationwide success the movement was split into factions by political ideology early on however now on the left the women's equity action league weal on the right the national women's political caucus nwpc in the center and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far leftalong with friedan gloria steinem was an important feminist leader cofounding the nwpc the women's action alliance and editing the movement's magazine ms the proposed equal rights amendment to the constitution passed by congress in 1972 and favored by about seventy percent of the american public failed to be ratified in 1982 with only three more states needed to make it law the nation's conservative women led by activist phyllis schlafly defeated the era by arguing that it degraded the position of the housewife and made young women susceptible to the military draft there was also a disconnect between the older relatively conservative betty friedan and the younger feminists many of whom favored leftwing politics and radical ideas such as forced redistribution of jobs and income from men to women friedan's primary interest was also in workplace and income inequality and she was largely unmoved by the abortion and sexual rights activists feeling in particular that abortion was an unimportant issue in addition the feminist movement remained dominated by relatively affluent white women it failed to attract many africanamerican females who tended to be of the opinion that they were victims of their race rather than their gender and that many of the feminists came from comfortable middleclass backgrounds who had seldom experienced serious hardship in their lives the failure of the era effectively marked the end of the women's liberation movementthe failure of the era notwithstanding many federal laws eg those equalizing pay employment education employment opportunities credit ending pregnancy discrimination and requiring nasa the military academies and other organizations to admit women state laws ie those ending spousal abuse and marital rape supreme court rulings ie ruling the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment applied to women and state eras established women's equal status under the law and social custom and consciousness began to change accepting women's equality

    question_text: although generally regarded as a conservative president richard nixon adopted many liberal positions especially regarding health care welfare spending environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities he maintained the high taxes and strong economic regulations of the new deal era he intervened aggressively in the economy in august 1971 he took the nation off the gold standard of the bretton woods system and imposed for a while price and wage controls nixon shocknixon reoriented us foreign policy away from containment and toward detente with both the soviet union and china playing them against each other → cold warconfrontation through détente 1962–79 the detente policy with china is still the basic policy in the 21st century while the soviet union su rejected detente and used american toleration to overexpand their operations in latin america asia and africa → foreign relations of the soviet unionthe 1970s onwards both su and china tolerated american policy in vietnam leaving their erstwhile ally north vietnam stranded nixon promoted vietnamization whereby the military of south vietnam would be greatly enhanced so that us forces could withdraw the combat troops were gone by 1971 and nixon could announce a peace treaty paris peace accords in january 1973 his promises to saigon that he would intervene if north vietnam attacked were validated in 1972 but became worthless when he resigned in august 1974 despite having an elaborate military south vietnam was too corrupt and too lacking in selfconfidence to effectively resist the invasion by north vietnam and saigon fell to the north in april 1975 thus ending the warin may 1970 the antiwar effort escalated into violence as national guard troops shot at student demonstrators in the kent state shootings the nation's higher education system especially the elite schools virtually shut downthe nixon administration seized on student demonstrations to mobilize a conservative majority consisting of middleclass suburbanites and workingclass whites critical of radical extremists economics also played a role in this mobilization as a result of the vietnam war and lyndon johnson's failure to raise taxes to pay for it inflation shot up and real incomes declined many lower middleclass whites were critical of federal programs targeted towards blacks and the poor with one observer noting that their wages were often only “a notch or so above the welfare payments of liberal states” and yet “they are excluded from social programs targeted at the disadvantaged” numerous articles published at that time focused on the feelings of discontent that existed amongst many americansalthough middleincome americans benefited from great society initiatives that also benefited lowincome americans such as medicare and federal aid to education and despite the fact that statistics indicated that blacks and the poor with the two groups often treated as one lived an immeasurably more painful existence than lower middleclass whites there existed a widespread feeling that slum residents and ghetto residents were now in the driver’s seat a poll taken by newsweek in 1969 found that a plurality of middle americans believed that blacks had a better chance of getting adequate schooling a decent home and a good job in that same poll 85 believed that black militants were let off too easily 84 that campus demonstrators were treated too leniently and 79 that most people receiving welfare could help themselves analysts traced sentiments such as these to the economic insecurity of those dubbed the “middle americans” those earning between 5000 and 15000 a year and including many white ethnics who were 55 of the american population most of these middle americans were bluecollar workers whitecollar employees school teachers and lowerechelon bureaucrats although not poor according to william h chafe they suffered from many of the tensions of marginal prosperity such as indebtness inflation and the fear of losing what they had worked so hard to attain from 1956 to 1966 income had increased by 86 while the cost of borrowing had gone up even more by 113 many families were hard pressed to hold on to their “middleclass” status particularly at a time when rising inflation brought an end to increases in real income struggling to get by many middle americans viewed antipoverty expenditures and black demands as representing a threat to their own wellbeingirregular employment was also a problem with 20 of workers in 1969 unemployed for some period of time a figure that rose to 23 in 1970 many people also had little or no savings by the end of the sixties with a fifth of the population in 1969 having no liquid assets and nearly half the population having less than 500by the end of 1967 as noted by william h chafe‘the shrill attacks on “establishment” values from the left were matched by an equally vociferous defense of traditional values by those who were proud of all their society had achieved if feminists blacks antiwar demonstrators and advocates for the poor attacked the status quo with uncompromising vehemence millions of other americans rallied around the flag and made clear their intent to uphold the lifestyle and values to which they had devoted their lives significantly pollsters richard scammon and ben watterburg pointed out the protesters still represented only a small minority of the country the great majority of americans were “unyoung unpoor and unblack they are middleaged middle class and middle minded” it was not a scenario from which dissidents could take much comfort’riding on high approval ratings nixon was reelected in 1972 soundly defeating the liberal antiwar george mcgovern at the same time nixon became a lightning rod for much public hostility regarding the war in vietnam the morality of conflict continued to be an issue and incidents such as the my lai massacre further eroded support for the war and increased efforts of vietnamizationthe growing watergate scandal was a major disaster for nixon eroding his political support in public opinion and in washington however he did manage to secure largescale funding for south vietnam much of which was wasted the united states withdrew its troops from vietnam before the paris peace accords in 1973 in 1975 north vietnam invaded with conventional army forces and quickly conquered the south the us was not involved in the fighting in 1975 but did evacuate many vietnamese later nearly one million managed to flee to the us as refugees the impact on the us was muted with few political recriminations but it did leave a vietnam syndrome that cautioned against further military interventions anywhere else nixon and his next two successors ford and carter had dropped the containment policy and were not willing to intervene anywhere

    question_text: at the same time that president johnson persuaded congress to accept a tax cut in 1964 he was rapidly increasing spending for both domestic programs and for the war in vietnam the result was a major expansion of the money supply resting largely on government deficits which pushed prices rapidly upward however inflation also rested on the nation's steadily declining supremacy in international trade and moreover the decline in the global economic geopolitical commercial technological and cultural preponderance of the united states since the end of world war ii after 1945 the us enjoyed easy access to raw materials and substantial markets for its goods abroad the us was responsible for around a third of the world's industrial output because of the devastation of postwar europe by the 1960s not only were the industrialized nations now competing for increasingly scarce raw commodities but third world suppliers were increasingly demanding higher prices the automobile steel and electronics industries were also beginning to face stiff competition in the us domestic market by foreign producers who had more modern factories and higherquality productsinflation had been an extremely gentle 3 a year from 1949 to 1969 but as the 70s unfolded this began to change and the cost of energy and consumer products began to steadily climb in addition to the increased manufacturing competition from europe and japan the us faced other difficulties due to the general complacency that set in during the years of prosperity many americans assumed the good times would last forever and there was little attempt at investing in infrastructure and modernized manufacturing outside of the defense and aerospace sectors the boundless optimism and belief in science and progress that characterized the 1950s60s quickly eroded and gave way to a general cynicism and distrust of technology among americans fueled by growing concern over the negative effects on the environment by air and water pollution from automobiles and manufacturing especially events such as the cuyahoga river fire in cleveland ohio in 1969 and the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979 nixon promised to tackle sluggish growth and inflation known as stagflation through higher taxes and lower spending this met stiff resistance in congress as a result nixon changed course and opted to control the currency his appointees to the federal reserve sought a contraction of the money supply through higher interest rates but to little avail the tight money policy did little to curb inflation the cost of living rose a cumulative 15 during nixon's first two years in officeby the summer of 1971 nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to reverse the economic tide on august 15 1971 he ended the convertibility of the us dollar into gold which meant the demise of the bretton woods system in place since world war ii as a result the us dollar fell in world markets the devaluation helped stimulate american exports but it also made the purchase of vital inputs raw materials and finished goods from abroad more expensive also on august 15 1971 under the provisions of the economic stabilization act of 1970 nixon implemented phase i of his economic plan a ninetyday freeze on all wages and prices above their existing levels in november phase ii entailed mandatory guidelines for wage and price increases to be issued by a federal agency inflation subsided temporarily but the recession continued with rising unemployment to combat the recession nixon reversed course and adopted an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in phase iii the strict wage and price controls were lifted as a result inflation resumed its upward spiralinflationary pressures led to key shifts in economic policies following the great depression of the 1930s recessions—periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment—were viewed as the greatest of economic threats which could be counteracted by heavy government spending or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more in the 1970s major price increases particularly for energy created a strong fear of inflation as a result government leaders concentrated more on controlling inflation than on combating recession by limiting spending resisting tax cuts and reining in growth in the money supply the erratic economic programs of the nixon administration were indicative of a broader national confusion about the prospects for future american prosperity with little understanding of the international forces creating the economic problems nixon american economists and the public focused on immediate issues and shortterm solutions these underlying problems set the stage for conservative reaction a more aggressive foreign policy and a retreat from welfarebased solutions for minorities and the poor that would characterize the subsequent decades

    question_text: although generally regarded as a conservative president richard nixon adopted many liberal positions especially regarding health care welfare spending environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities he maintained the high taxes and strong economic regulations of the new deal era he intervened aggressively in the economy in august 1971 he took the nation off the gold standard of the bretton woods system and imposed for a while price and wage controls nixon shocknixon reoriented us foreign policy away from containment and toward detente with both the soviet union and china playing them against each other → cold warconfrontation through détente 1962–79 the detente policy with china is still the basic policy in the 21st century while the soviet union su rejected detente and used american toleration to overexpand their operations in latin america asia and africa → foreign relations of the soviet unionthe 1970s onwards both su and china tolerated american policy in vietnam leaving their erstwhile ally north vietnam stranded nixon promoted vietnamization whereby the military of south vietnam would be greatly enhanced so that us forces could withdraw the combat troops were gone by 1971 and nixon could announce a peace treaty paris peace accords in january 1973 his promises to saigon that he would intervene if north vietnam attacked were validated in 1972 but became worthless when he resigned in august 1974 despite having an elaborate military south vietnam was too corrupt and too lacking in selfconfidence to effectively resist the invasion by north vietnam and saigon fell to the north in april 1975 thus ending the warin may 1970 the antiwar effort escalated into violence as national guard troops shot at student demonstrators in the kent state shootings the nation's higher education system especially the elite schools virtually shut downthe nixon administration seized on student demonstrations to mobilize a conservative majority consisting of middleclass suburbanites and workingclass whites critical of radical extremists economics also played a role in this mobilization as a result of the vietnam war and lyndon johnson's failure to raise taxes to pay for it inflation shot up and real incomes declined many lower middleclass whites were critical of federal programs targeted towards blacks and the poor with one observer noting that their wages were often only “a notch or so above the welfare payments of liberal states” and yet “they are excluded from social programs targeted at the disadvantaged” numerous articles published at that time focused on the feelings of discontent that existed amongst many americansalthough middleincome americans benefited from great society initiatives that also benefited lowincome americans such as medicare and federal aid to education and despite the fact that statistics indicated that blacks and the poor with the two groups often treated as one lived an immeasurably more painful existence than lower middleclass whites there existed a widespread feeling that slum residents and ghetto residents were now in the driver’s seat a poll taken by newsweek in 1969 found that a plurality of middle americans believed that blacks had a better chance of getting adequate schooling a decent home and a good job in that same poll 85 believed that black militants were let off too easily 84 that campus demonstrators were treated too leniently and 79 that most people receiving welfare could help themselves analysts traced sentiments such as these to the economic insecurity of those dubbed the “middle americans” those earning between 5000 and 15000 a year and including many white ethnics who were 55 of the american population most of these middle americans were bluecollar workers whitecollar employees school teachers and lowerechelon bureaucrats although not poor according to william h chafe they suffered from many of the tensions of marginal prosperity such as indebtness inflation and the fear of losing what they had worked so hard to attain from 1956 to 1966 income had increased by 86 while the cost of borrowing had gone up even more by 113 many families were hard pressed to hold on to their “middleclass” status particularly at a time when rising inflation brought an end to increases in real income struggling to get by many middle americans viewed antipoverty expenditures and black demands as representing a threat to their own wellbeingirregular employment was also a problem with 20 of workers in 1969 unemployed for some period of time a figure that rose to 23 in 1970 many people also had little or no savings by the end of the sixties with a fifth of the population in 1969 having no liquid assets and nearly half the population having less than 500by the end of 1967 as noted by william h chafe‘the shrill attacks on “establishment” values from the left were matched by an equally vociferous defense of traditional values by those who were proud of all their society had achieved if feminists blacks antiwar demonstrators and advocates for the poor attacked the status quo with uncompromising vehemence millions of other americans rallied around the flag and made clear their intent to uphold the lifestyle and values to which they had devoted their lives significantly pollsters richard scammon and ben watterburg pointed out the protesters still represented only a small minority of the country the great majority of americans were “unyoung unpoor and unblack they are middleaged middle class and middle minded” it was not a scenario from which dissidents could take much comfort’riding on high approval ratings nixon was reelected in 1972 soundly defeating the liberal antiwar george mcgovern at the same time nixon became a lightning rod for much public hostility regarding the war in vietnam the morality of conflict continued to be an issue and incidents such as the my lai massacre further eroded support for the war and increased efforts of vietnamizationthe growing watergate scandal was a major disaster for nixon eroding his political support in public opinion and in washington however he did manage to secure largescale funding for south vietnam much of which was wasted the united states withdrew its troops from vietnam before the paris peace accords in 1973 in 1975 north vietnam invaded with conventional army forces and quickly conquered the south the us was not involved in the fighting in 1975 but did evacuate many vietnamese later nearly one million managed to flee to the us as refugees the impact on the us was muted with few political recriminations but it did leave a vietnam syndrome that cautioned against further military interventions anywhere else nixon and his next two successors ford and carter had dropped the containment policy and were not willing to intervene anywhere

    question_text: at the same time that president johnson persuaded congress to accept a tax cut in 1964 he was rapidly increasing spending for both domestic programs and for the war in vietnam the result was a major expansion of the money supply resting largely on government deficits which pushed prices rapidly upward however inflation also rested on the nation's steadily declining supremacy in international trade and moreover the decline in the global economic geopolitical commercial technological and cultural preponderance of the united states since the end of world war ii after 1945 the us enjoyed easy access to raw materials and substantial markets for its goods abroad the us was responsible for around a third of the world's industrial output because of the devastation of postwar europe by the 1960s not only were the industrialized nations now competing for increasingly scarce raw commodities but third world suppliers were increasingly demanding higher prices the automobile steel and electronics industries were also beginning to face stiff competition in the us domestic market by foreign producers who had more modern factories and higherquality productsinflation had been an extremely gentle 3 a year from 1949 to 1969 but as the 70s unfolded this began to change and the cost of energy and consumer products began to steadily climb in addition to the increased manufacturing competition from europe and japan the us faced other difficulties due to the general complacency that set in during the years of prosperity many americans assumed the good times would last forever and there was little attempt at investing in infrastructure and modernized manufacturing outside of the defense and aerospace sectors the boundless optimism and belief in science and progress that characterized the 1950s60s quickly eroded and gave way to a general cynicism and distrust of technology among americans fueled by growing concern over the negative effects on the environment by air and water pollution from automobiles and manufacturing especially events such as the cuyahoga river fire in cleveland ohio in 1969 and the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979 nixon promised to tackle sluggish growth and inflation known as stagflation through higher taxes and lower spending this met stiff resistance in congress as a result nixon changed course and opted to control the currency his appointees to the federal reserve sought a contraction of the money supply through higher interest rates but to little avail the tight money policy did little to curb inflation the cost of living rose a cumulative 15 during nixon's first two years in officeby the summer of 1971 nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to reverse the economic tide on august 15 1971 he ended the convertibility of the us dollar into gold which meant the demise of the bretton woods system in place since world war ii as a result the us dollar fell in world markets the devaluation helped stimulate american exports but it also made the purchase of vital inputs raw materials and finished goods from abroad more expensive also on august 15 1971 under the provisions of the economic stabilization act of 1970 nixon implemented phase i of his economic plan a ninetyday freeze on all wages and prices above their existing levels in november phase ii entailed mandatory guidelines for wage and price increases to be issued by a federal agency inflation subsided temporarily but the recession continued with rising unemployment to combat the recession nixon reversed course and adopted an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in phase iii the strict wage and price controls were lifted as a result inflation resumed its upward spiralinflationary pressures led to key shifts in economic policies following the great depression of the 1930s recessions—periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment—were viewed as the greatest of economic threats which could be counteracted by heavy government spending or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more in the 1970s major price increases particularly for energy created a strong fear of inflation as a result government leaders concentrated more on controlling inflation than on combating recession by limiting spending resisting tax cuts and reining in growth in the money supply the erratic economic programs of the nixon administration were indicative of a broader national confusion about the prospects for future american prosperity with little understanding of the international forces creating the economic problems nixon american economists and the public focused on immediate issues and shortterm solutions these underlying problems set the stage for conservative reaction a more aggressive foreign policy and a retreat from welfarebased solutions for minorities and the poor that would characterize the subsequent decades

    question_text: although generally regarded as a conservative president richard nixon adopted many liberal positions especially regarding health care welfare spending environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities he maintained the high taxes and strong economic regulations of the new deal era he intervened aggressively in the economy in august 1971 he took the nation off the gold standard of the bretton woods system and imposed for a while price and wage controls nixon shocknixon reoriented us foreign policy away from containment and toward detente with both the soviet union and china playing them against each other → cold warconfrontation through détente 1962–79 the detente policy with china is still the basic policy in the 21st century while the soviet union su rejected detente and used american toleration to overexpand their operations in latin america asia and africa → foreign relations of the soviet unionthe 1970s onwards both su and china tolerated american policy in vietnam leaving their erstwhile ally north vietnam stranded nixon promoted vietnamization whereby the military of south vietnam would be greatly enhanced so that us forces could withdraw the combat troops were gone by 1971 and nixon could announce a peace treaty paris peace accords in january 1973 his promises to saigon that he would intervene if north vietnam attacked were validated in 1972 but became worthless when he resigned in august 1974 despite having an elaborate military south vietnam was too corrupt and too lacking in selfconfidence to effectively resist the invasion by north vietnam and saigon fell to the north in april 1975 thus ending the warin may 1970 the antiwar effort escalated into violence as national guard troops shot at student demonstrators in the kent state shootings the nation's higher education system especially the elite schools virtually shut downthe nixon administration seized on student demonstrations to mobilize a conservative majority consisting of middleclass suburbanites and workingclass whites critical of radical extremists economics also played a role in this mobilization as a result of the vietnam war and lyndon johnson's failure to raise taxes to pay for it inflation shot up and real incomes declined many lower middleclass whites were critical of federal programs targeted towards blacks and the poor with one observer noting that their wages were often only “a notch or so above the welfare payments of liberal states” and yet “they are excluded from social programs targeted at the disadvantaged” numerous articles published at that time focused on the feelings of discontent that existed amongst many americansalthough middleincome americans benefited from great society initiatives that also benefited lowincome americans such as medicare and federal aid to education and despite the fact that statistics indicated that blacks and the poor with the two groups often treated as one lived an immeasurably more painful existence than lower middleclass whites there existed a widespread feeling that slum residents and ghetto residents were now in the driver’s seat a poll taken by newsweek in 1969 found that a plurality of middle americans believed that blacks had a better chance of getting adequate schooling a decent home and a good job in that same poll 85 believed that black militants were let off too easily 84 that campus demonstrators were treated too leniently and 79 that most people receiving welfare could help themselves analysts traced sentiments such as these to the economic insecurity of those dubbed the “middle americans” those earning between 5000 and 15000 a year and including many white ethnics who were 55 of the american population most of these middle americans were bluecollar workers whitecollar employees school teachers and lowerechelon bureaucrats although not poor according to william h chafe they suffered from many of the tensions of marginal prosperity such as indebtness inflation and the fear of losing what they had worked so hard to attain from 1956 to 1966 income had increased by 86 while the cost of borrowing had gone up even more by 113 many families were hard pressed to hold on to their “middleclass” status particularly at a time when rising inflation brought an end to increases in real income struggling to get by many middle americans viewed antipoverty expenditures and black demands as representing a threat to their own wellbeingirregular employment was also a problem with 20 of workers in 1969 unemployed for some period of time a figure that rose to 23 in 1970 many people also had little or no savings by the end of the sixties with a fifth of the population in 1969 having no liquid assets and nearly half the population having less than 500by the end of 1967 as noted by william h chafe‘the shrill attacks on “establishment” values from the left were matched by an equally vociferous defense of traditional values by those who were proud of all their society had achieved if feminists blacks antiwar demonstrators and advocates for the poor attacked the status quo with uncompromising vehemence millions of other americans rallied around the flag and made clear their intent to uphold the lifestyle and values to which they had devoted their lives significantly pollsters richard scammon and ben watterburg pointed out the protesters still represented only a small minority of the country the great majority of americans were “unyoung unpoor and unblack they are middleaged middle class and middle minded” it was not a scenario from which dissidents could take much comfort’riding on high approval ratings nixon was reelected in 1972 soundly defeating the liberal antiwar george mcgovern at the same time nixon became a lightning rod for much public hostility regarding the war in vietnam the morality of conflict continued to be an issue and incidents such as the my lai massacre further eroded support for the war and increased efforts of vietnamizationthe growing watergate scandal was a major disaster for nixon eroding his political support in public opinion and in washington however he did manage to secure largescale funding for south vietnam much of which was wasted the united states withdrew its troops from vietnam before the paris peace accords in 1973 in 1975 north vietnam invaded with conventional army forces and quickly conquered the south the us was not involved in the fighting in 1975 but did evacuate many vietnamese later nearly one million managed to flee to the us as refugees the impact on the us was muted with few political recriminations but it did leave a vietnam syndrome that cautioned against further military interventions anywhere else nixon and his next two successors ford and carter had dropped the containment policy and were not willing to intervene anywhere

    question_text: at the same time that president johnson persuaded congress to accept a tax cut in 1964 he was rapidly increasing spending for both domestic programs and for the war in vietnam the result was a major expansion of the money supply resting largely on government deficits which pushed prices rapidly upward however inflation also rested on the nation's steadily declining supremacy in international trade and moreover the decline in the global economic geopolitical commercial technological and cultural preponderance of the united states since the end of world war ii after 1945 the us enjoyed easy access to raw materials and substantial markets for its goods abroad the us was responsible for around a third of the world's industrial output because of the devastation of postwar europe by the 1960s not only were the industrialized nations now competing for increasingly scarce raw commodities but third world suppliers were increasingly demanding higher prices the automobile steel and electronics industries were also beginning to face stiff competition in the us domestic market by foreign producers who had more modern factories and higherquality productsinflation had been an extremely gentle 3 a year from 1949 to 1969 but as the 70s unfolded this began to change and the cost of energy and consumer products began to steadily climb in addition to the increased manufacturing competition from europe and japan the us faced other difficulties due to the general complacency that set in during the years of prosperity many americans assumed the good times would last forever and there was little attempt at investing in infrastructure and modernized manufacturing outside of the defense and aerospace sectors the boundless optimism and belief in science and progress that characterized the 1950s60s quickly eroded and gave way to a general cynicism and distrust of technology among americans fueled by growing concern over the negative effects on the environment by air and water pollution from automobiles and manufacturing especially events such as the cuyahoga river fire in cleveland ohio in 1969 and the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979 nixon promised to tackle sluggish growth and inflation known as stagflation through higher taxes and lower spending this met stiff resistance in congress as a result nixon changed course and opted to control the currency his appointees to the federal reserve sought a contraction of the money supply through higher interest rates but to little avail the tight money policy did little to curb inflation the cost of living rose a cumulative 15 during nixon's first two years in officeby the summer of 1971 nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to reverse the economic tide on august 15 1971 he ended the convertibility of the us dollar into gold which meant the demise of the bretton woods system in place since world war ii as a result the us dollar fell in world markets the devaluation helped stimulate american exports but it also made the purchase of vital inputs raw materials and finished goods from abroad more expensive also on august 15 1971 under the provisions of the economic stabilization act of 1970 nixon implemented phase i of his economic plan a ninetyday freeze on all wages and prices above their existing levels in november phase ii entailed mandatory guidelines for wage and price increases to be issued by a federal agency inflation subsided temporarily but the recession continued with rising unemployment to combat the recession nixon reversed course and adopted an expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in phase iii the strict wage and price controls were lifted as a result inflation resumed its upward spiralinflationary pressures led to key shifts in economic policies following the great depression of the 1930s recessions—periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment—were viewed as the greatest of economic threats which could be counteracted by heavy government spending or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more in the 1970s major price increases particularly for energy created a strong fear of inflation as a result government leaders concentrated more on controlling inflation than on combating recession by limiting spending resisting tax cuts and reining in growth in the money supply the erratic economic programs of the nixon administration were indicative of a broader national confusion about the prospects for future american prosperity with little understanding of the international forces creating the economic problems nixon american economists and the public focused on immediate issues and shortterm solutions these underlying problems set the stage for conservative reaction a more aggressive foreign policy and a retreat from welfarebased solutions for minorities and the poor that would characterize the subsequent decades

    question_text: ronald reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population he proposed to achieve this goal by cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of federal programs critics of his plan charged that the tax cuts would reduce revenues leading to large federal deficits which would lead in turn to higher interest rates stifling any economic benefits reagan and his supporters drawing on the theories of supplyside economics claimed that the tax cuts would increase revenues through economic growth allowing the federal government to balance its budget for the first time since 1969reagan's 1981 economic legislation however was a mixture of rival programs to satisfy all his conservative constituencies monetarists cold warriors middleclass swing voters and the affluent monetarists were placated by tight controls of the money supply cold warriors especially neoconservatives like kirkpatrick won large increases in the defense budget wealthy taxpayers won sweeping threeyear tax rate reductions on both individual marginal rates would eventually come down to 50 from 70 and corporate taxes and the middle class saw that its pensions and entitlements would not be targeted reagan declared spending cuts for the social security budget which accounted for almost half of government spending off limits due to fears over an electoral backlash but the administration was hard pressed to explain how his program of sweeping tax cuts and large defense spending would not increase the deficitbudget director david stockman raced to put reagan's program through congress within the administration's deadline of forty days stockman had no doubt that spending cuts were needed and slashed expenditures across the board with the exception of defense expenditures by some 40 billion and when figures did not add up he resorted to the magic asterisk—which signified future savings to be identified he would later say that the program was rushed through too quickly and not given enough thought appeals from constituencies threatened by the loss of social services were ineffectual the budget cuts passed through the congress with relative ease

    question_text: by early 1982 reagan's economic program was beset with difficulties as the recession that had begun in 1979 continued in the short term the effect of reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit government borrowing along with the tightening of the money supply resulted in sky high interest rates briefly hovering around 20 percent and a serious recession with 10percent unemployment in 1982 some regions of the rust belt the industrial midwest and northeast descended into virtual depression conditions as steel mills and other industries closed many family farms in the midwest and elsewhere were ruined by high interest rates and sold off to large agribusinessesreagan allowed the federal reserve to drastically reduce the money supply to cure inflation but it resulted in the recession deepening temporarily his approval ratings plummeted in the worst months of the recession of 1982 democrats swept the midterm elections making up for their losses in the previous election cycle at the time critics often accused reagan of being out of touch his budget director david stockman an ardent fiscal conservative wrote i knew the reagan revolution was impossibleit was a metaphor with no anchor in political and economic realityunemployment reached a peak of 11 in late 1982 after which recovery began a factor in the recovery from the worst periods of 198283 was the radical drop in oil prices due to increased production levels of the mid1980s which ended inflationary pressures on fuel prices the virtual collapse of the opec cartel enabled the administration to alter its tight money policies to the consternation of conservative monetarist economists who began pressing for a reduction of interest rates and an expansion of the money supply in effect subordinating concern about inflation which now seemed under control to concern about unemployment and declining investmentby the middle of 1983 unemployment fell from 11 percent in 1982 to 82 percent gdp growth was 33 percent the highest since the mid1970s inflation was below 5 percent when the economy recovered ronald reagan declared it was morning in america housing starts boomed the automobile industry recovered its vitality and consumer spending achieved new heights bluecollar workers were however mostly left behind in the economic boom years of the reagan administration and the old factory jobs that had once offered high wages to even unskilled workers no longer existedreagan went on to defeat walter mondale in the 1984 presidential election by a large landslide

    question_text: following the economic recovery that began in 1983 the mediumterm fiscal effect of reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit as spending continually exceeded revenue due to tax cuts and increased defense spending military budgets rose while tax revenues despite having increased as compared to the stagnant late 1970s and early 1980s failed to make up for the spiraling costthe 1981 tax cuts one of the largest in us history also eroded the revenue base of the federal government in the shortterm the massive increase in military spending about 16 trillion over five years far exceeded cuts in social spending despite wrenching impact of such cuts spending geared toward some of the poorest segments of society even so by the end of 1985 funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as congress could toleratein this context the deficit rose from 60 billion in 1980 to a peak of 220 billion in 1986 well over 5 of gdp over this period national debt more than doubled from 749 billion to 1746 billionsince us saving rates were very low roughly onethird of japan's the deficit was mostly covered by borrowing from abroad turning the united states within a few years from the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor not only was this damaging to america's status it was also a profound shift in the postwar international financial system which had relied on the export of us capital in addition the media and entertainment industry during the 1980s glamorized the stock market and financial sector eg the 1987 movie wall street causing many young people to pursue careers as brokers investors or bankers instead of manufacturing and making it unlikely that any of the lost industrial base would be restored any time soonthe deficits were keeping interest rates although lower than the 20 peak levels earlier in the administration due to a respite in the administration's tight money policies high and threatening to push them higher the government was thus forced to borrow so much money to pay its bills that it was driving up the price of borrowing although supplysiders promised increased investment as a result of toprate and corporate tax cuts growth and investment suffered for now in the context of high interest rates in october 1987 a sudden and alarming stock market crash took place but the federal reserve responded by increasing the money supply and averted what could have been another great depressionperhaps more alarmingly reaganera deficits were keeping the us dollar overvalued with such a high demand for dollars due in large measure to government borrowing the dollar achieved an alarming strength against other major currencies as the dollar soared in value so american exports became increasingly uncompetitive with japan as the leading beneficiary the high value of the dollar made it difficult for foreigners to buy american goods and encouraged americans to buy imports coming at a high price to the industrial export sector steel and other heavy industries declined due to excessive demands by labor unions and outdated technology that made them unable to compete with japanese imports the consumer electronics industry which had begun declining in the 1970s was one of the worst victims of dumping and other unfair japanese trade practices american consumer electronics also suffered from poor quality and a relative lack of technical innovation compared to japanese electronics in part because the cold war had caused most american scientific and engineering effort to go into the defense sector rather than the consumer one by the end of the decade it had virtually ceased to exist on the bright side the upstart computer industry flourished during the 1980sthe us balance of trade grew increasingly unfavorable the trade deficit grew from 20 billion to well over 100 billion thus american industries such as automobiles and steel faced renewed competition abroad and within the domestic market as well the auto industry was given breathing space after the reagan administration imposed voluntary import restraints on japanese manufacturers allowing them to sell a maximum of 13 million vehicles in the us per year and imposed a 25 tariff on all imported trucks a lighter 3 tariff was put on passenger cars the japanese responded by opening assembly plants in the us to get around this and in doing so were able to say that they were providing americans with jobs the vir was repealed in 1985 after auto sales were booming again but the tariffs remain in effect to this day with the event of cafe regulations small cars came to dominate in the 1980s and much like with electronics japanese makes bested american ones in terms of build quality and technical sophisticationthe enormous deficits were in large measure holdovers from lyndon johnson's commitment to both guns and butter the vietnam war and the great society and the growing competition from other g7 nations after their postwar reconstruction but it was the reagan administration that chose to let the deficits developreagan asked congress for a lineitem veto which would allow him to lower the deficits by cutting spending that he thought was wasteful but he did not receive it he also called for a balanced budget amendment which would mandate that the federal government spends no more money than it takes in which never materialized

    question_text: with reagan's promises to restore the nation's military strength the 1980s saw massive increases in military spending amounting to about 16 trillion over five years a new arms race would develop as superpower relations deteriorated to a level not seen since the kennedy administration a generation earlierreagan's foreign policy was generally considered more successful and well thought out than his domestic he favored a hawkish approach to the cold war especially in the third world arena of superpower competition in the wake of the vietnam debacle however americans were increasingly skeptical of bearing the economic and financial cost of large troop commitments the administration sought to overcome this by backing the relatively cheap strategy of specially trained counterinsurgencies or lowintensity conflicts rather than largescale campaigns like korea and vietnam which were enormously costly both in money and human lifethe arabisraeli conflict was another impetus for military action israel invaded lebanon to destroy the palestine liberation organization plo but in the wake of the 1982 sabra and shatila massacre which provoked a political crisis in israel and international embarrassment us forces moved into beirut to encourage israeli withdrawal previously the administration stood by israel's invasion of lebanon in mid1982 to maintain the support of israel on one hand but also to quell the influence of israel's prosoviet enemy syria in lebanon however us intervention in the multisided lebanese civil war had disastrous consequences on

affair in 1985 reagan authorized the sale of arms in iran in an unsuccessful effort to free us hostages in lebanon he later professed ignorance that subordinates were illegally diverting the proceeds to the contras a matter for which marine lieutenant colonel oliver north an aide to national security advisor john m poindexter took much of the blame reagan's approval ratings plummeted in 1986 as a result of the scandal and many americans began to seriously question his judgement while the president's popularity improved in his final two years he would never again enjoy the support he had had in 1985 predictably the democrats regained control of congress in the 1986 midterm elections oliver north meanwhile achieved a brief celebrity status in 1987 during his testimonies before congressin subsaharan africa the reagan administration with help from apartheid south africa also attempted to topple the substantially cuban and sovietbacked marxist–leninist frelimo and mpla dictatorships of mozambique and angola respectively during those countries' civil wars the administration intervened on the side of insurgent groups renamo in mozambique and unita in angola supplying each group with covert military and humanitarian aidin afghanistan reagan massively stepped up military and humanitarian aid for mujahideen fighters against the soviet proxy government there providing them with stinger antiaircraft missiles us allies saudi arabia and pakistan also provided the rebels with significant assistance general secretary mikhail gorbachev reduced and eventually ended his country's commitment to afghanistan as soviet troops there were bogged down in guerrilla warreagan also expressed opposition to the vietnameseinstalled communist regime of heng samrin and later hun sen in cambodia which had ousted the genocidal khmer rouge regime after vietnam invaded the country the administration approved military and humanitarian aid to the republican kpnlf and royalist funcinpec insurgents the reagan administration also supported continued un recognition of the coalition government of democratic kampuchea a tripartite rebel alliance of the kpnlf funcinpec and the khmer rouge over the vietnamesebacked people's republic of kampuchea regime reagan also continued american support for the autocratic philippine president ferdinand marcos an ardent anticommunist in a 1984 presidential debate sponsored by the league of women voters he explained his administration's support of marcos by stating i know there are things there in the philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights but what is the alternative? it is a large communist movement 1 referring to active communist guerrillas operating in the philippines at the time the us also had significant strategic military interests in the philippines knowing that marcos's government would not tamper with agreements to maintain us naval bases in the country marcos was later ousted in 1986 by the mostly peaceful people power movement led by corazón aquinoreagan was sharply critical of the united nations once the darling of liberals he repudiated its repudiation of its corruption inefficiency and antiamericanism in 19857 the us withdrew from unesco which had failed in its cultural missions and began to deliberately withhold its un dues american policymakers considered this tactic an effective tool for asserting influence in the un when the un and unesco mended their ways the us returned and paid its dues

    question_text: the reagan administration adopted a hardline stance toward the ussr early in his first term the president attacked the rival superpower as the evil empire while it was jimmy carter who had officially ended the policy of détente following soviet intervention in afghanistan eastwest tensions in the early 1980s reached levels not seen since the cuban missile crisis the strategic defense initiative sdi was born out of the worsening ussoviet relations of the reagan era popularly dubbed star wars at the time sdi was a multibilliondollar research project for a missile defense system that could shoot down incoming soviet missiles and eliminate the need for mutually assured destructionwhile the soviets had enjoyed great achievements on the international stage before reagan entered office in 1981 such as the unification of their socialist ally vietnam in 1976 and a string of socialist revolutions in southeast asia latin america and africa the country's strengthening ties with third world nations in the 1960s and 1970s only masked its weakness the soviet economy suffered severe structural problems and started suffering from an increased stagnation in the 1970s documents being circulated in the kremlin in 1980 when carter was still president expressed the bleak view that moscow ultimately could not win the technological or ideological battle with the usthere was a growing body of evidence that the soviet union which three generations of americans had been conditioned to believe was an undefeatable colossus was really a paper tiger during 1981 the us navy conducted a series of exercises in the arctic ocean a few miles from the soviet coast and went completely undetected proving the deficiency of the latter's radar and detection capabilitieseastwest tensions eased rapidly after the rise of mikhail gorbachev after the deaths of three elderly soviet leaders in a row since 1982 the politburo elected gorbachev soviet communist party chief in 1985 marking the rise of a new generation of leadership under gorbachev relatively young reformoriented technocrats rapidly consolidated power providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the westfocused on perestroika gorbachev struggled to boost production of consumer goods which would be impossible given the twin burdens of the cold war arms race on one hand and the provision of large sums of foreign and military aid which the socialist allies had grown to expect on the other under gorbachev soviet policymakers increasingly accepted reagan administration warnings that the us would make the arms race a huge burden for them the soviets were already spending massive amounts on defense and developing a counterpart to sdi was far more than their economy could handle the result in the soviet union was a dual approach of concessions to the united states and economic restructuring perestroika and democratization glasnost domestically which eventually made it impossible for gorbachev to reassert central control reaganite hawks have since argued that pressures stemming from increased us defense spending was an additional impetus for reformduring the cold war the division of the world into two rival blocs had served to legitimize a broad and diffuse alliance not only with the western european nations of the north atlantic treaty organization nato but many countries in the developing world starting in the late 1980s however the regimes of the eastern european warsaw pact began to collapse in rapid succession the fall of the berlin wall was seen as a symbol of the fall of the eastern european communist governments in 1989 ussoviet relations had greatly improved in the latter half of the decade with the signing of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty inf in 1987 and the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan as well as cuban forces from angolathese developments undercut the rationale for providing support to such repressive governments as those in chile and south korea which underwent processes of democratization with us support during the same period as those of warsaw pact nations some us commentators believed that this warming of relations between the two greatest powers of the cold war should lead to a peace dividend where us military spending would be drastically reduced this argument was essentially lost in the political debate with the onset of the gulf war instead president george h w bush argued for the emergence of a new world order freer from the threat of terror stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace an era in which the nations of the world east and west north and south can prosper and live in harmonynationalist agitation in the baltic states for independence led to first lithuania and then the other two states estonia and latvia declaring independence from the soviet union on december 26 1991 the ussr was officially disbanded breaking up into fifteen constituent parts the cold war was over and the vacuum left by the collapse of governments such as in yugoslavia and somalia revealed or reopened other animosities concealed by decades of authoritarian rule while there was a certain reluctance among the us public and even within the government to get involved in localized conflicts in which there was little or no direct us interest at stake these crises served as a basis for the renewal of western alliances while communism was becoming less relevant to this effect president bill clinton would declare in his inaugural address today as an old order passes the new world is more free but less stable communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers clearly america must continue to lead the world we did so much to makesince the end of the cold war the us has sought to revitalize cold war institutional structures especially nato as well as multilateral institutions such as the international monetary fund and world bank through which it promotes economic reforms around the globe nato was set to expand initially to hungary poland and the czech republic and has since moved further eastward in addition us policy placed a special emphasis on the neoliberal washington consensus manifesting in the north american free trade agreement nafta which went into effect in 1994the us often made moves to economically sanction countries which were said to be sponsoring terrorism engaging in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or committing serious human rights abuses there was sometimes a consensus for these moves such as with the us and european embargoes imposed on arms sales to china after its violent suppression of the tiananmen square protests of 1989 as well as for the un security council's imposition of sanctions on iraq after its invasion of kuwait support for other unilateral sanctions however such as the ones levied on iran and cuba were limited leading congress to impose measures intended to punish foreign companies which violated the terms of the us's own lawsin a 1999 foreign affairs essay samuel p huntington wrote that to reinforce its status in the post–cold war worldthe united states has among other things attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following pressure other countries to adopt american values and practices regarding human rights and democracy prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter american conventional superiority enforce american law extraterritorially in other societies grade countries according to their adherence to american standards on human rights drugs terrorism nuclear proliferation missile proliferation and now religious freedom apply sanctions against countries that do not meet american standards on these issues promote american corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets nafta and gatt being the main examples of the free trade policy initiatives of the 1990s shape world bank and international monetary fund policies to serve those same corporate interests intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest   promote american arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries force out one un secretarygeneral and dictate the appointment of his successor expand nato initially to include poland hungary and the czech republic and no one else undertake military action against iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime and categorize certain countries as 'rogue states' excluding them from global institutions1max boot another influential contemporary commentator on us policy argues that the very ambitious goals of the us in the post–cold war periodaims to instill democracy in lands that have known tyranny in the hope that doing so will shortcircuit terrorism military aggression and weapons proliferationhe addsthis is an ambitious undertaking the most successful examples of which are post–world war ii germany italy and japan in those cases the us army helped transform militaristic dictatorships into pillars of liberal democracy—one of the most significant developments of the twentieth century 2

    question_text: following the economic recovery that began in 1983 the mediumterm fiscal effect of reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit as spending continually exceeded revenue due to tax cuts and increased defense spending military budgets rose while tax revenues despite having increased as compared to the stagnant late 1970s and early 1980s failed to make up for the spiraling costthe 1981 tax cuts one of the largest in us history also eroded the revenue base of the federal government in the shortterm the massive increase in military spending about 16 trillion over five years far exceeded cuts in social spending despite wrenching impact of such cuts spending geared toward some of the poorest segments of society even so by the end of 1985 funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as congress could toleratein this context the deficit rose from 60 billion in 1980 to a peak of 220 billion in 1986 well over 5 of gdp over this period national debt more than doubled from 749 billion to 1746 billionsince us saving rates were very low roughly onethird of japan's the deficit was mostly covered by borrowing from abroad turning the united states within a few years from the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor not only was this damaging to america's status it was also a profound shift in the postwar international financial system which had relied on the export of us capital in addition the media and entertainment industry during the 1980s glamorized the stock market and financial sector eg the 1987 movie wall street causing many young people to pursue careers as brokers investors or bankers instead of manufacturing and making it unlikely that any of the lost industrial base would be restored any time soonthe deficits were keeping interest rates although lower than the 20 peak levels earlier in the administration due to a respite in the administration's tight money policies high and threatening to push them higher the government was thus forced to borrow so much money to pay its bills that it was driving up the price of borrowing although supplysiders promised increased investment as a result of toprate and corporate tax cuts growth and investment suffered for now in the context of high interest rates in october 1987 a sudden and alarming stock market crash took place but the federal reserve responded by increasing the money supply and averted what could have been another great depressionperhaps more alarmingly reaganera deficits were keeping the us dollar overvalued with such a high demand for dollars due in large measure to government borrowing the dollar achieved an alarming strength against other major currencies as the dollar soared in value so american exports became increasingly uncompetitive with japan as the leading beneficiary the high value of the dollar made it difficult for foreigners to buy american goods and encouraged americans to buy imports coming at a high price to the industrial export sector steel and other heavy industries declined due to excessive demands by labor unions and outdated technology that made them unable to compete with japanese imports the consumer electronics industry which had begun declining in the 1970s was one of the worst victims of dumping and other unfair japanese trade practices american consumer electronics also suffered from poor quality and a relative lack of technical innovation compared to japanese electronics in part because the cold war had caused most american scientific and engineering effort to go into the defense sector rather than the consumer one by the end of the decade it had virtually ceased to exist on the bright side the upstart computer industry flourished during the 1980sthe us balance of trade grew increasingly unfavorable the trade deficit grew from 20 billion to well over 100 billion thus american industries such as automobiles and steel faced renewed competition abroad and within the domestic market as well the auto industry was given breathing space after the reagan administration imposed voluntary import restraints on japanese manufacturers allowing them to sell a maximum of 13 million vehicles in the us per year and imposed a 25 tariff on all imported trucks a lighter 3 tariff was put on passenger cars the japanese responded by opening assembly plants in the us to get around this and in doing so were able to say that they were providing americans with jobs the vir was repealed in 1985 after auto sales were booming again but the tariffs remain in effect to this day with the event of cafe regulations small cars came to dominate in the 1980s and much like with electronics japanese makes bested american ones in terms of build quality and technical sophisticationthe enormous deficits were in large measure holdovers from lyndon johnson's commitment to both guns and butter the vietnam war and the great society and the growing competition from other g7 nations after their postwar reconstruction but it was the reagan administration that chose to let the deficits developreagan asked congress for a lineitem veto which would allow him to lower the deficits by cutting spending that he thought was wasteful but he did not receive it he also called for a balanced budget amendment which would mandate that the federal government spends no more money than it takes in which never materialized

    question_text: with reagan's promises to restore the nation's military strength the 1980s saw massive increases in military spending amounting to about 16 trillion over five years a new arms race would develop as superpower relations deteriorated to a level not seen since the kennedy administration a generation earlierreagan's foreign policy was generally considered more successful and well thought out than his domestic he favored a hawkish approach to the cold war especially in the third world arena of superpower competition in the wake of the vietnam debacle however americans were increasingly skeptical of bearing the economic and financial cost of large troop commitments the administration sought to overcome this by backing the relatively cheap strategy of specially trained counterinsurgencies or lowintensity conflicts rather than largescale campaigns like korea and vietnam which were enormously costly both in money and human lifethe arabisraeli conflict was another impetus for military action israel invaded lebanon to destroy the palestine liberation organization plo but in the wake of the 1982 sabra and shatila massacre which provoked a political crisis in israel and international embarrassment us forces moved into beirut to encourage israeli withdrawal previously the administration stood by israel's invasion of lebanon in mid1982 to maintain the support of israel on one hand but also to quell the influence of israel's prosoviet enemy syria in lebanon however us intervention in the multisided lebanese civil war had disastrous consequences on october 23 1983 the marine barracks bombing killed 241 american troops shortly afterward the us withdrew its remaining 1600 soldiersin operation urgent fury the united states for the first time invaded and successfully rolled back a communist regime on october 19 the small island nation of grenada had undergone a coup d'état by bernard coard a staunch marxist–leninist seeking to strengthen the country's existing ties with cuba the soviet union and other communist states the prime minister was killed and insurgents had orders to shoot on sight over 1000 americans were on the island mostly medical students and their families and the government could not guarantee their security the organisation of eastern caribbean states the regional security association of neighboring states led by prime minister eugenia charles of dominica officially called on the united states for protection in a short campaign launched oct 25 fought primarily against armed cuban construction workers the us military invaded and took control and democracy was restored to grenadareagan launched an air strike against libya after it was found to have connections to a bombing in berlin which killed two american soldiersthe reagan administration also supplied funds and weapons to heavily militarilyinfluenced governments in el salvador beginning in 1980 and honduras and to a lesser extent in guatemala which was ruled by rightwing military autocrat general efraín ríos montt from 198283 it reversed expresident jimmy carter's official condemnation of the argentine junta for human rights abuses and allowed the cia to collaborate with argentine intelligence in funding the contras central america was the administration's primary concern especially el salvador and nicaragua where the sandinista revolution brought down the formerly usbacked somoza family rule the two countries had been historically dominated by multinational corporations and wealthy landowning oligarchs while most of their population remained in poverty as a result predominantly marxist revolutionary leaders had won increasing support from the peasantry in both nationsin 1982 the cia with assistance from the argentine national intelligence agency organized and financed rightwing paramilitaries in nicaragua known as the contras the tracing of secret funds for this scheme led to the revelations of the irancontra affair in 1985 reagan authorized the sale of arms in iran in an unsuccessful effort to free us hostages in lebanon he later professed ignorance that subordinates were illegally diverting the proceeds to the contras a matter for which marine lieutenant colonel oliver north an aide to national security advisor john m poindexter took much of the blame reagan's approval ratings plummeted in 1986 as a result of the scandal and many americans began to seriously question his judgement while the president's popularity improved in his final two years he would never again enjoy the support he had had in 1985 predictably the democrats regained control of congress in the 1986 midterm elections oliver north meanwhile achieved a brief celebrity status in 1987 during his testimonies before congressin subsaharan africa the reagan administration with help from apartheid south africa also attempted to topple the substantially cuban and sovietbacked marxist–leninist frelimo and mpla dictatorships of mozambique and angola respectively during those countries' civil wars the administration intervened on the side of insurgent groups renamo in mozambique and unita in angola supplying each group with covert military and humanitarian aidin afghanistan reagan massively stepped up military and humanitarian aid for mujahideen fighters against the soviet proxy government there providing them with stinger antiaircraft missiles us allies saudi arabia and pakistan also provided the rebels with significant assistance general secretary mikhail gorbachev reduced and eventually ended his country's commitment to afghanistan as soviet troops there were bogged down in guerrilla warreagan also expressed opposition to the vietnameseinstalled communist regime of heng samrin and later hun sen in cambodia which had ousted the genocidal khmer rouge regime after vietnam invaded the country the administration approved military and humanitarian aid to the republican kpnlf and royalist funcinpec insurgents the reagan administration also supported continued un recognition of the coalition government of democratic kampuchea a tripartite rebel alliance of the kpnlf funcinpec and the khmer rouge over the vietnamesebacked people's republic of kampuchea regime reagan also continued american support for the autocratic philippine president ferdinand marcos an ardent anticommunist in a 1984 presidential debate sponsored by the league of women voters he explained his administration's support of marcos by stating i know there are things there in the philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights but what is the alternative? it is a large communist movement 1 referring to active communist guerrillas operating in the philippines at the time the us also had significant strategic military interests in the philippines knowing that marcos's government would not tamper with agreements to maintain us naval bases in the country marcos was later ousted in 1986 by the mostly peaceful people power movement led by corazón aquinoreagan was sharply critical of the united nations once the darling of liberals he repudiated its repudiation of its corruption inefficiency and antiamericanism in 19857 the us withdrew from unesco which had failed in its cultural missions and began to deliberately withhold its un dues american policymakers considered this tactic an effective tool for asserting influence in the un when the un and unesco mended their ways the us returned and paid its dues

    question_text: the reagan administration adopted a hardline stance toward the ussr early in his first term the president attacked the rival superpower as the evil empire while it was jimmy carter who had officially ended the policy of détente following soviet intervention in afghanistan eastwest tensions in the early 1980s reached levels not seen since the cuban missile crisis the strategic defense initiative sdi was born out of the worsening ussoviet relations of the reagan era popularly dubbed star wars at the time sdi was a multibilliondollar research project for a missile defense system that could shoot down incoming soviet missiles and eliminate the need for mutually assured destructionwhile the soviets had enjoyed great achievements on the international stage before reagan entered office in 1981 such as the unification of their socialist ally vietnam in 1976 and a string of socialist revolutions in southeast asia latin america and africa the country's strengthening ties with third world nations in the 1960s and 1970s only masked its weakness the soviet economy suffered severe structural problems and started suffering from an increased stagnation in the 1970s documents being circulated in the kremlin in 1980 when carter was still president expressed the bleak view that moscow ultimately could not win the technological or ideological battle with the usthere was a growing body of evidence that the soviet union which three generations of americans had been conditioned to believe was an undefeatable colossus was really a paper tiger during 1981 the us navy conducted a series of exercises in the arctic ocean a few miles from the soviet coast and went completely undetected proving the deficiency of the latter's radar and detection capabilitieseastwest tensions eased rapidly after the rise of mikhail gorbachev after the deaths of three elderly soviet leaders in a row since 1982 the politburo elected gorbachev soviet communist party chief in 1985 marking the rise of a new generation of leadership under gorbachev relatively young reformoriented technocrats rapidly consolidated power providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the westfocused on perestroika gorbachev struggled to boost production of consumer goods which would be impossible given the twin burdens of the cold war arms race on one hand and the provision of large sums of foreign and military aid which the socialist allies had grown to expect on the other under gorbachev soviet policymakers increasingly accepted reagan administration warnings that the us would make the arms race a huge burden for them the soviets were already spending massive amounts on defense and developing a counterpart to sdi was far more than their economy could handle the result in the soviet union was a dual approach of concessions to the united states and economic restructuring perestroika and democratization glasnost domestically which eventually made it impossible for gorbachev to reassert central control reaganite hawks have since argued that pressures stemming from increased us defense spending was an additional impetus for reformduring the cold war the division of the world into two rival blocs had served to legitimize a broad and diffuse alliance not only with the western european nations of the north atlantic treaty organization nato but many countries in the developing world starting in the late 1980s however the regimes of the eastern european warsaw pact began to collapse in rapid succession the fall of the berlin wall was seen as a symbol of the fall of the eastern european communist governments in 1989 ussoviet relations had greatly improved in the latter half of the decade with the signing of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty inf in 1987 and the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan as well as cuban forces from angolathese developments undercut the rationale for providing support to such repressive governments as those in chile and south korea which underwent processes of democratization with us support during the same period as those of warsaw pact nations some us commentators believed that this warming of relations between the two greatest powers of the cold war should lead to a peace dividend where us military spending would be drastically reduced this argument was essentially lost in the political debate with the onset of the gulf war instead president george h w bush argued for the emergence of a new world order freer from the threat of terror stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace an era in which the nations of the world east and west north and south can prosper and live in harmonynationalist agitation in the baltic states for independence led to first lithuania and then the other two states estonia and latvia declaring independence from the soviet union on december 26 1991 the ussr was officially disbanded breaking up into fifteen constituent parts the cold war was over and the vacuum left by the collapse of governments such as in yugoslavia and somalia revealed or reopened other animosities concealed by decades of authoritarian rule while there was a certain reluctance among the us public and even within the government to get involved in localized conflicts in which there was little or no direct us interest at stake these crises served as a basis for the renewal of western alliances while communism was becoming less relevant to this effect president bill clinton would declare in his inaugural address today as an old order passes the new world is more free but less stable communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers clearly america must continue to lead the world we did so much to makesince the end of the cold war the us has sought to revitalize cold war institutional structures especially nato as well as multilateral institutions such as the international monetary fund and world bank through which it promotes economic reforms around the globe nato was set to expand initially to hungary poland and the czech republic and has since moved further eastward in addition us policy placed a special emphasis on the neoliberal washington consensus manifesting in the north american free trade agreement nafta which went into effect in 1994the us often made moves to economically sanction countries which were said to be sponsoring terrorism engaging in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or committing serious human rights abuses there was sometimes a consensus for these moves such as with the us and european embargoes imposed on arms sales to china after its violent suppression of the tiananmen square protests of 1989 as well as for the un security council's imposition of sanctions on iraq after its invasion of kuwait support for other unilateral sanctions however such as the ones levied on iran and cuba were limited leading congress to impose measures intended to punish foreign companies which violated the terms of the us's own lawsin a 1999 foreign affairs essay samuel p huntington wrote that to reinforce its status in the post–cold war worldthe united states has among other things attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following pressure other countries to adopt american values and practices regarding human rights and democracy prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter american conventional superiority enforce american law extraterritorially in other societies grade countries according to their adherence to american standards on human rights drugs terrorism nuclear proliferation missile proliferation and now religious freedom apply sanctions against countries that do not meet american standards on these issues promote american corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets nafta and gatt being the main examples of the free trade policy initiatives of the 1990s shape world bank and international monetary fund policies to serve those same corporate interests intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest   promote american arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries force out one un secretarygeneral and dictate the appointment of his successor expand nato initially to include poland hungary and the czech republic and no one else undertake military action against iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime and categorize certain countries as 'rogue states' excluding them from global institutions1max boot another influential contemporary commentator on us policy argues that the very ambitious goals of the us in the post–cold war periodaims to instill democracy in lands that have known tyranny in the hope that doing so will shortcircuit terrorism military aggression and weapons proliferationhe addsthis is an ambitious undertaking the most successful examples of which are post–world war ii germany italy and japan in those cases the us army helped transform militaristic dictatorships into pillars of liberal democracy—one of the most significant developments of the twentieth century 2

    question_text: after years of unstinting praise from the right and unrelenting criticism from the left historian david henry lines finds that by 2010 a consensus had emerged among scholars that reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right by demonstrating a pragmatic conservatism that promoted ideology within the constraints imposed by the divided political system furthermore says henry the consensus agrees that he revived faith in the presidency and american selfconfidence and contributed critically to ending the cold warreagan's approach to the presidency was somewhat of a departure from his predecessors he delegated a great deal of work to his subordinates letting them handle most of the government's daytoday affairs as an executive reagan framed broad themes and made a strong personal connection to voters he used very strong aides especially chief of staff james baker ford's campaign manager and michael deaver as deputy chief of staff and edwin meese as white house counsel as well as david stockman at the bureau of the budget and his own campaign manager bill casey at the ciaon march 30 1981 reagan was shot in washington by a disturbed nonpolitical man he recovered fully with opponents silenced in the meanwhilereagan stunned the nation by appointing the first woman to the supreme court sandra day o'connor in 1981 he promoted conservative leader william rehnquist to chief justice in 1986 with archconservative antonin scalia taking rehnquist's slot his fourth appointment in 1987 proved controversial as the initial choice had to withdraw he smoked marijuana in college and the senate rejected robert bork reagan finally won approval for anthony kennedy

    question_text: ronald reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population he proposed to achieve this goal by cutting taxes and reducing the size and scope of federal programs critics of his plan charged that the tax cuts would reduce revenues leading to large federal deficits which would lead in turn to higher interest rates stifling any economic benefits reagan and his supporters drawing on the theories of supplyside economics claimed that the tax cuts would increase revenues through economic growth allowing the federal government to balance its budget for the first time since 1969reagan's 1981 economic legislation however was a mixture of rival programs to satisfy all his conservative constituencies monetarists cold warriors middleclass swing voters and the affluent monetarists were placated by tight controls of the money supply cold warriors especially neoconservatives like kirkpatrick won large increases in the defense budget wealthy taxpayers won sweeping threeyear tax rate reductions on both individual marginal rates would eventually come down to 50 from 70 and corporate taxes and the middle class saw that its pensions and entitlements would not be targeted reagan declared spending cuts for the social security budget which accounted for almost half of government spending off limits due to fears over an electoral backlash but the administration was hard pressed to explain how his program of sweeping tax cuts and large defense spending would not increase the deficitbudget director david stockman raced to put reagan's program through congress within the administration's deadline of forty days stockman had no doubt that spending cuts were needed and slashed expenditures across the board with the exception of defense expenditures by some 40 billion and when figures did not add up he resorted to the magic asterisk—which signified future savings to be identified he would later say that the program was rushed through too quickly and not given enough thought appeals from constituencies threatened by the loss of social services were ineffectual the budget cuts passed through the congress with relative ease

    question_text: by early 1982 reagan's economic program was beset with difficulties as the recession that had begun in 1979 continued in the short term the effect of reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit government borrowing along with the tightening of the money supply resulted in sky high interest rates briefly hovering around 20 percent and a serious recession with 10percent unemployment in 1982 some regions of the rust belt the industrial midwest and northeast descended into virtual depression conditions as steel mills and other industries closed many family farms in the midwest and elsewhere were ruined by high interest rates and sold off to large agribusinessesreagan allowed the federal reserve to drastically reduce the money supply to cure inflation but it resulted in the recession deepening temporarily his approval ratings plummeted in the worst months of the recession of 1982 democrats swept the midterm elections making up for their losses in the previous election cycle at the time critics often accused reagan of being out of touch his budget director david stockman an ardent fiscal conservative wrote i knew the reagan revolution was impossibleit was a metaphor with no anchor in political and economic realityunemployment reached a peak of 11 in late 1982 after which recovery began a factor in the recovery from the worst periods of 198283 was the radical drop in oil prices due to increased production levels of the mid1980s which ended inflationary pressures on fuel prices the virtual collapse of the opec cartel enabled the administration to alter its tight money policies to the consternation of conservative monetarist economists who began pressing for a reduction of interest rates and an expansion of the money supply in effect subordinating concern about inflation which now seemed under control to concern about unemployment and declining investmentby the middle of 1983 unemployment fell from 11 percent in 1982 to 82 percent gdp growth was 33 percent the highest since the mid1970s inflation was below 5 percent when the economy recovered ronald reagan declared it was morning in america housing starts boomed the automobile industry recovered its vitality and consumer spending achieved new heights bluecollar workers were however mostly left behind in the economic boom years of the reagan administration and the old factory jobs that had once offered high wages to even unskilled workers no longer existedreagan went on to defeat walter mondale in the 1984 presidential election by a large landslide

    question_text: following the economic recovery that began in 1983 the mediumterm fiscal effect of reaganomics was a soaring budget deficit as spending continually exceeded revenue due to tax cuts and increased defense spending military budgets rose while tax revenues despite having increased as compared to the stagnant late 1970s and early 1980s failed to make up for the spiraling costthe 1981 tax cuts one of the largest in us history also eroded the revenue base of the federal government in the shortterm the massive increase in military spending about 16 trillion over five years far exceeded cuts in social spending despite wrenching impact of such cuts spending geared toward some of the poorest segments of society even so by the end of 1985 funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as congress could toleratein this context the deficit rose from 60 billion in 1980 to a peak of 220 billion in 1986 well over 5 of gdp over this period national debt more than doubled from 749 billion to 1746 billionsince us saving rates were very low roughly onethird of japan's the deficit was mostly covered by borrowing from abroad turning the united states within a few years from the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor not only was this damaging to america's status it was also a profound shift in the postwar international financial system which had relied on the export of us capital in addition the media and entertainment industry during the 1980s glamorized the stock market and financial sector eg the 1987 movie wall street causing many young people to pursue careers as brokers investors or bankers instead of manufacturing and making it unlikely that any of the lost industrial base would be restored any time soonthe deficits were keeping interest rates although lower than the 20 peak levels earlier in the administration due to a respite in the administration's tight money policies high and threatening to push them higher the government was thus forced to borrow so much money to pay its bills that it was driving up the price of borrowing although supplysiders promised increased investment as a result of toprate and corporate tax cuts growth and investment suffered for now in the context of high interest rates in october 1987 a sudden and alarming stock market crash took place but the federal reserve responded by increasing the money supply and averted what could have been another great depressionperhaps more alarmingly reaganera deficits were keeping the us dollar overvalued with such a high demand for dollars due in large measure to government borrowing the dollar achieved an alarming strength against other major currencies as the dollar soared in value so american exports became increasingly uncompetitive with japan as the leading beneficiary the high value of the dollar made it difficult for foreigners to buy american goods and encouraged americans to buy imports coming at a high price to the industrial export sector steel and other heavy industries declined due to excessive demands by labor unions and outdated technology that made them unable to compete with japanese imports the consumer electronics industry which had begun declining in the 1970s was one of the worst victims of dumping and other unfair japanese trade practices american consumer electronics also suffered from poor quality and a relative lack of technical innovation compared to japanese electronics in part because the cold war had caused most american scientific and engineering effort to go into the defense sector rather than the consumer one by the end of the decade it had virtually ceased to exist on the bright side the upstart computer industry flourished during the 1980sthe us balance of trade grew increasingly unfavorable the trade deficit grew from 20 billion to well over 100 billion thus american industries such as automobiles and steel faced renewed competition abroad and within the domestic market as well the auto industry was given breathing space after the reagan administration imposed voluntary import restraints on japanese manufacturers allowing them to sell a maximum of 13 million vehicles in the us per year and imposed a 25 tariff on all imported trucks a lighter 3 tariff was put on passenger cars the japanese responded by opening assembly plants in the us to get around this and in doing so were able to say that they were providing americans with jobs the vir was repealed in 1985 after auto sales were booming again but the tariffs remain in effect to this day with the event of cafe regulations small cars came to dominate in the 1980s and much like with electronics japanese makes bested american ones in terms of build quality and technical sophisticationthe enormous deficits were in large measure holdovers from lyndon johnson's commitment to both guns and butter the vietnam war and the great society and the growing competition from other g7 nations after their postwar reconstruction but it was the reagan administration that chose to let the deficits developreagan asked congress for a lineitem veto which would allow him to lower the deficits by cutting spending that he thought was wasteful but he did not receive it he also called for a balanced budget amendment which would mandate that the federal government spends no more money than it takes in which never materialized

    question_text: with reagan's promises to restore the nation's military strength the 1980s saw massive increases in military spending amounting to about 16 trillion over five years a new arms race would develop as superpower relations deteriorated to a level not seen since the kennedy administration a generation earlierreagan's foreign policy was generally considered more successful and well thought out than his domestic he favored a hawkish approach to the cold war especially in the third world arena of superpower competition in the wake of the vietnam debacle however americans were increasingly skeptical of bearing the economic and financial cost of large troop commitments the administration sought to overcome this by backing the relatively cheap strategy of specially trained counterinsurgencies or lowintensity conflicts rather than largescale campaigns like korea and vietnam which were enormously costly both in money and human lifethe arabisraeli conflict was another impetus for military action israel invaded lebanon to destroy the palestine liberation organization plo but in the wake of the 1982 sabra and shatila massacre which provoked a political crisis in israel and international embarrassment us forces moved into beirut to encourage israeli withdrawal previously the administration stood by israel's invasion of lebanon in mid1982 to maintain the support of israel on one hand but also to quell the influence of israel's prosoviet enemy syria in lebanon however us intervention in the multisided lebanese civil war had disastrous consequences on october 23 1983 the marine barracks bombing killed 241 american troops shortly afterward the us withdrew its remaining 1600 soldiersin operation urgent fury the united states for the first time invaded and successfully rolled back a communist regime on october 19 the small island nation of grenada had undergone a coup d'état by bernard coard a staunch marxist–leninist seeking to strengthen the country's existing ties with cuba the soviet union and other communist states the prime minister was killed and insurgents had orders to shoot on sight over 1000 americans were on the island mostly medical students and their families and the government could not guarantee their security the organisation of eastern caribbean states the regional security association of neighboring states led by prime minister eugenia charles of dominica officially called on the united states for protection in a short campaign launched oct 25 fought primarily against armed cuban construction workers the us military invaded and took control and democracy was restored to grenadareagan launched an air strike against libya after it was found to have connections to a bombing in berlin which killed two american soldiersthe reagan administration also supplied funds and weapons to heavily militarilyinfluenced governments in el salvador beginning in 1980 and honduras and to a lesser extent in guatemala which was ruled by rightwing military autocrat general efraín ríos montt from 198283 it reversed expresident jimmy carter's official condemnation of the argentine junta for human rights abuses and allowed the cia to collaborate with argentine intelligence in funding the contras central america was the administration's primary concern especially el salvador and nicaragua where the sandinista revolution brought down the formerly usbacked somoza family rule the two countries had been historically dominated by multinational corporations and wealthy landowning oligarchs while most of their population remained in poverty as a result predominantly marxist revolutionary leaders had won increasing support from the peasantry in both nationsin 1982 the cia with assistance from the argentine national intelligence agency organized and financed rightwing paramilitaries in nicaragua known as the contras the tracing of secret funds for this scheme led to the revelations of the irancontra affair in 1985 reagan authorized the sale of arms in iran in an unsuccessful effort to free us hostages in lebanon he later professed ignorance that subordinates were illegally diverting the proceeds to the contras a matter for which marine lieutenant colonel oliver north an aide to national security advisor john m poindexter took much of the blame reagan's approval ratings plummeted in 1986 as a result of the scandal and many americans began to seriously question his judgement while the president's popularity improved in his final two years he would never again enjoy the support he had had in 1985 predictably the democrats regained control of congress in the 1986 midterm elections oliver north meanwhile achieved a brief celebrity status in 1987 during his testimonies before congressin subsaharan africa the reagan administration with help from apartheid south africa also attempted to topple the substantially cuban and sovietbacked marxist–leninist frelimo and mpla dictatorships of mozambique and angola respectively during those countries' civil wars the administration intervened on the side of insurgent groups renamo in mozambique and unita in angola supplying each group with covert military and humanitarian aidin afghanistan reagan massively stepped up military and humanitarian aid for mujahideen fighters against the soviet proxy government there providing them with stinger antiaircraft missiles us allies saudi arabia and pakistan also provided the rebels with significant assistance general secretary mikhail gorbachev reduced and eventually ended his country's commitment to afghanistan as soviet troops there were bogged down in guerrilla warreagan also expressed opposition to the vietnameseinstalled communist regime of heng samrin and later hun sen in cambodia which had ousted the genocidal khmer rouge regime after vietnam invaded the country the administration approved military and humanitarian aid to the republican kpnlf and royalist funcinpec insurgents the reagan administration also supported continued un recognition of the coalition government of democratic kampuchea a tripartite rebel alliance of the kpnlf funcinpec and the khmer rouge over the vietnamesebacked people's republic of kampuchea regime reagan also continued american support for the autocratic philippine president ferdinand marcos an ardent anticommunist in a 1984 presidential debate sponsored by the league of women voters he explained his administration's support of marcos by stating i know there are things there in the philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights but what is the alternative? it is a large communist movement 1 referring to active communist guerrillas operating in the philippines at the time the us also had significant strategic military interests in the philippines knowing that marcos's government would not tamper with agreements to maintain us naval bases in the country marcos was later ousted in 1986 by the mostly peaceful people power movement led by corazón aquinoreagan was sharply critical of the united nations once the darling of liberals he repudiated its repudiation of its corruption inefficiency and antiamericanism in 19857 the us withdrew from unesco which had failed in its cultural missions and began to deliberately withhold its un dues american policymakers considered this tactic an effective tool for asserting influence in the un when the un and unesco mended their ways the us returned and paid its dues

    question_text: the reagan administration adopted a hardline stance toward the ussr early in his first term the president attacked the rival superpower as the evil empire while it was jimmy carter who had officially ended the policy of détente following soviet intervention in afghanistan eastwest tensions in the early 1980s reached levels not seen since the cuban missile crisis the strategic defense initiative sdi was born out of the worsening ussoviet relations of the reagan era popularly dubbed star wars at the time sdi was a multibilliondollar research project for a missile defense system that could shoot down incoming soviet missiles and eliminate the need for mutually assured destructionwhile the soviets had enjoyed great achievements on the international stage before reagan entered office in 1981 such as the unification of their socialist ally vietnam in 1976 and a string of socialist revolutions in southeast asia latin america and africa the country's strengthening ties with third world nations in the 1960s and 1970s only masked its weakness the soviet economy suffered severe structural problems and started suffering from an increased stagnation in the 1970s documents being circulated in the kremlin in 1980 when carter was still president expressed the bleak view that moscow ultimately could not win the technological or ideological battle with the usthere was a growing body of evidence that the soviet union which three generations of americans had been conditioned to believe was an undefeatable colossus was really a paper tiger during 1981 the us navy conducted a series of exercises in the arctic ocean a few miles from the soviet coast and went completely undetected proving the deficiency of the latter's radar and detection capabilitieseastwest tensions eased rapidly after the rise of mikhail gorbachev after the deaths of three elderly soviet leaders in a row since 1982 the politburo elected gorbachev soviet communist party chief in 1985 marking the rise of a new generation of leadership under gorbachev relatively young reformoriented technocrats rapidly consolidated power providing new momentum for political and economic liberalization and the impetus for cultivating warmer relations and trade with the westfocused on perestroika gorbachev struggled to boost production of consumer goods which would be impossible given the twin burdens of the cold war arms race on one hand and the provision of large sums of foreign and military aid which the socialist allies had grown to expect on the other under gorbachev soviet policymakers increasingly accepted reagan administration warnings that the us would make the arms race a huge burden for them the soviets were already spending massive amounts on defense and developing a counterpart to sdi was far more than their economy could handle the result in the soviet union was a dual approach of concessions to the united states and economic restructuring perestroika and democratization glasnost domestically which eventually made it impossible for gorbachev to reassert central control reaganite hawks have since argued that pressures stemming from increased us defense spending was an additional impetus for reformduring the cold war the division of the world into two rival blocs had served to legitimize a broad and diffuse alliance not only with the western european nations of the north atlantic treaty organization nato but many countries in the developing world starting in the late 1980s however the regimes of the eastern european warsaw pact began to collapse in rapid succession the fall of the berlin wall was seen as a symbol of the fall of the eastern european communist governments in 1989 ussoviet relations had greatly improved in the latter half of the decade with the signing of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty inf in 1987 and the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan as well as cuban forces from angolathese developments undercut the rationale for providing support to such repressive governments as those in chile and south korea which underwent processes of democratization with us support during the same period as those of warsaw pact nations some us commentators believed that this warming of relations between the two greatest powers of the cold war should lead to a peace dividend where us military spending would be drastically reduced this argument was essentially lost in the political debate with the onset of the gulf war instead president george h w bush argued for the emergence of a new world order freer from the threat of terror stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace an era in which the nations of the world east and west north and south can prosper and live in harmonynationalist agitation in the baltic states for independence led to first lithuania and then the other two states estonia and latvia declaring independence from the soviet union on december 26 1991 the ussr was officially disbanded breaking up into fifteen constituent parts the cold war was over and the vacuum left by the collapse of governments such as in yugoslavia and somalia revealed or reopened other animosities concealed by decades of authoritarian rule while there was a certain reluctance among the us public and even within the government to get involved in localized conflicts in which there was little or no direct us interest at stake these crises served as a basis for the renewal of western alliances while communism was becoming less relevant to this effect president bill clinton would declare in his inaugural address today as an old order passes the new world is more free but less stable communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers clearly america must continue to lead the world we did so much to makesince the end of the cold war the us has sought to revitalize cold war institutional structures especially nato as well as multilateral institutions such as the international monetary fund and world bank through which it promotes economic reforms around the globe nato was set to expand initially to hungary poland and the czech republic and has since moved further eastward in addition us policy placed a special emphasis on the neoliberal washington consensus manifesting in the north american free trade agreement nafta which went into effect in 1994the us often made moves to economically sanction countries which were said to be sponsoring terrorism engaging in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or committing serious human rights abuses there was sometimes a consensus for these moves such as with the us and european embargoes imposed on arms sales to china after its violent suppression of the tiananmen square protests of 1989 as well as for the un security council's imposition of sanctions on iraq after its invasion of kuwait support for other unilateral sanctions however such as the ones levied on iran and cuba were limited leading congress to impose measures intended to punish foreign companies which violated the terms of the us's own lawsin a 1999 foreign affairs essay samuel p huntington wrote that to reinforce its status in the post–cold war worldthe united states has among other things attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following pressure other countries to adopt american values and practices regarding human rights and democracy prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter american conventional superiority enforce american law extraterritorially in other societies grade countries according to their adherence to american standards on human rights drugs terrorism nuclear proliferation missile proliferation and now religious freedom apply sanctions against countries that do not meet american standards on these issues promote american corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets nafta and gatt being the main examples of the free trade policy initiatives of the 1990s shape world bank and international monetary fund policies to serve those same corporate interests intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest   promote american arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries force out one un secretarygeneral and dictate the appointment of his successor expand nato initially to include poland hungary and the czech republic and no one else undertake military action against iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime and categorize certain countries as 'rogue states' excluding them from global institutions1max boot another influential contemporary commentator on us policy argues that the very ambitious goals of the us in the post–cold war periodaims to instill democracy in lands that have known tyranny in the hope that doing so will shortcircuit terrorism military aggression and weapons proliferationhe addsthis is an ambitious undertaking the most successful examples of which are post–world war ii germany italy and japan in those cases the us army helped transform militaristic dictatorships into pillars of liberal democracy—one of the most significant developments of the twentieth century 2

    question_text: the new deal the great society and watergate helped solidify democratic control of congress but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition when the popularity of democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with congress' governing capacities the strongly liberal policies of clinton's first two years in office were also a cause of controversy and the democrats suddenly lost control of the house and the senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections once in power house republicans led by newt gingrich faced the difficulty of learning to govern after 40 years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their contract with america which they unveiled on the steps of congress on september 27 1994along with strong backing from traditional democrats and liberals clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who appreciated his centrist new democrat policies which steered away from the expansion of government services of the new deal and great society and allowed him to triangulate taking away many of the republicans' top issues one example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996 the new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments but did allow states to exempt 20 of their caseloads from the time limits clinton also pursued tough federal anticrime measures steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs and calling for the hiring of 100000 new police officers compromise came with difficulty though as the parties failed to agree on a budget causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996 by the end of his administration the federal government had experienced the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus the first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the social security trust fundin the 1996 presidential election clinton faced bob dole republican senator from kansas an uninspired insider dole failed to attract the support of the gop base and the incumbent president pulled to victory in the november election ross perot ran for a second time but was not allowed at the debate between clinton and dole and failed to attract as much support as he had in 1992 as a sign of the general cynicism and voter apathy during this period turnout for the election was only 49many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook longstanding rumors of extramarital affairs by clinton deeming them irrelevant these matters came to a head however in february 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between clinton and a white house intern monica lewinsky clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky his wife hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a vast rightwing conspiracy clinton was forced to retract his assertions in august 1998 after the lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel kenneth starr clinton was impeached in the united states house of representatives but acquitted at his trial by the us senate a public backlash forced speaker gingrich to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections in 1999 republican dennis hastert of illinois became speaker of the house a position he would hold until 2007 making him the longestserving republican speaker of the house

vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote early in his term bush signed a 13 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the economy but the wars in the middle east as well as assorted domestic spending packages passed by the republican congress led to ballooning federal deficits other laws enacted in his first term included the no child left behind act education reform bill in 2002 the partialbirth abortion ban act in 2003 and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act in 2004 the first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful however it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end the year 2001 was plagued by a ninemonth recession witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance with output increasing only 03 and unemployment and business failures risingon september 11 2001 alqaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the world trade

possessed chemical and nuclear weapons and posed a clear and present danger to stability in the middle east plans for a fullscale military invasion of the country began amid widespread controversy antiwar protests occurred around the us and numerous other countries mostly carried out by leftwing organizations but some on the right and various military and diplomatic figures also doubted the wisdom of this venture regardless the invasion of iraq commenced on march 20 2003 the iraqi army disintegrated without much resistance and within three weeks us troops entered baghdad to an overjoyed mob of iraqi civilians who proceeded to tear down the giant statue of saddam hussein in the middle of the city bush announced on may 1 2003 from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in iraq were completed with a mission accomplished banner serving as a backdrop although the war was initially popular a guerrilla insurgency quickly began mostly by al qaeda operatives who had entered the country led by abu musab alzarqawi a wave of bombings and beheadings of captives occurred including the highly publicized killing of government contractor nick berg zarqawi was killed by us troops in 2005 ineffective policing strategies led to a mounting death toll among soldiers but eventually in 2007 a campaign known as the surge began where the us army launched a largescale antiterrorism offensive along with the help of iraqi locals unhappy with the destruction caused by largely foreigner al qaeda agents the surge resulted in the end of most major violence in the country late in 2003

reelected in november 2004 defeating democratic contender john kerry in the electoral vote and receiving 507 of the popular vote against john kerry's 483 republicans also made gains in both houses of congress bush's reelection was assured by support for the war on terror the dour kerry's lack of appeal to his voter base and the excessive attacks made on the president by the democrat left which helped turn public opinion against them in addition it came out that kerry a vietnam war veteran had participated in antiwar protests after returning home in 1970 including throwing away his medalssome major acts in bush's second term included the energy policy act of 2005 the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act and the troubled asset relief program after seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term bush's popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term due to his handling of the prolonged iraq war hurricane katrina and the 2008 financial

combination of slower healthcost growth and budget cuts the latter championed by republicans many more people have health insurance thanks to mr obama's health law more people are graduating from

    question_text: the new deal the great society and watergate helped solidify democratic control of congress but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition when the popularity of democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with congress' governing capacities the strongly liberal policies of clinton's first two years in office were also a cause of controversy and the democrats suddenly lost control of the house and the senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections once in power house republicans led by newt gingrich faced the difficulty of learning to govern after 40 years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their contract with america which they unveiled on the steps of congress on september 27 1994along with strong backing from traditional democrats and liberals clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who appreciated his centrist new democrat policies which steered away from the expansion of government services of the new deal and great society and allowed him to triangulate taking away many of the republicans' top issues one example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996 the new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments but did allow states to exempt 20 of their caseloads from the time limits clinton also pursued tough federal anticrime measures steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs and calling for the hiring of 100000 new police officers compromise came with difficulty though as the parties failed to agree on a budget causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996 by the end of his administration the federal government had experienced the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus the first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the social security trust fundin the 1996 presidential election clinton faced bob dole republican senator from kansas an uninspired insider dole failed to attract the support of the gop base and the incumbent president pulled to victory in the november election ross perot ran for a second time but was not allowed at the debate between clinton and dole and failed to attract as much support as he had in 1992 as a sign of the general cynicism and voter apathy during this period turnout for the election was only 49many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook longstanding rumors of extramarital affairs by clinton deeming them irrelevant these matters came to a head however in february 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between clinton and a white house intern monica lewinsky clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky his wife hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a vast rightwing conspiracy clinton was forced to retract his assertions in august 1998 after the lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel kenneth starr clinton was impeached in the united states house of representatives but acquitted at his trial by the us senate a public backlash forced speaker gingrich to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections in 1999 republican dennis hastert of illinois became speaker of the house a position he would hold until 2007 making him the longestserving republican speaker of the house

vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote early in his term bush signed a 13 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the economy but the wars in the middle east as well as assorted domestic spending packages passed by the republican congress led to ballooning federal deficits other laws enacted in his first term included the no child left behind act education reform bill in 2002 the partialbirth abortion ban act in 2003 and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act in 2004 the first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful however it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end the year 2001 was plagued by a ninemonth recession witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance with output increasing only 03 and unemployment and business failures risingon september 11 2001 alqaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the world trade

possessed chemical and nuclear weapons and posed a clear and present danger to stability in the middle east plans for a fullscale military invasion of the country began amid widespread controversy antiwar protests occurred around the us and numerous other countries mostly carried out by leftwing organizations but some on the right and various military and diplomatic figures also doubted the wisdom of this venture regardless the invasion of iraq commenced on march 20 2003 the iraqi army disintegrated without much resistance and within three weeks us troops entered baghdad to an overjoyed mob of iraqi civilians who proceeded to tear down the giant statue of saddam hussein in the middle of the city bush announced on may 1 2003 from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in iraq were completed with a mission accomplished banner serving as a backdrop although the war was initially popular a guerrilla insurgency quickly began mostly by al qaeda operatives who had entered the country led by abu musab alzarqawi a wave of bombings and beheadings of captives occurred including the highly publicized killing of government contractor nick berg zarqawi was killed by us troops in 2005 ineffective policing strategies led to a mounting death toll among soldiers but eventually in 2007 a campaign known as the surge began where the us army launched a largescale antiterrorism offensive along with the help of iraqi locals unhappy with the destruction caused by largely foreigner al qaeda agents the surge resulted in the end of most major violence in the country late in 2003

reelected in november 2004 defeating democratic contender john kerry in the electoral vote and receiving 507 of the popular vote against john kerry's 483 republicans also made gains in both houses of congress bush's reelection was assured by support for the war on terror the dour kerry's lack of appeal to his voter base and the excessive attacks made on the president by the democrat left which helped turn public opinion against them in addition it came out that kerry a vietnam war veteran had participated in antiwar protests after returning home in 1970 including throwing away his medalssome major acts in bush's second term included the energy policy act of 2005 the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act and the troubled asset relief program after seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term bush's popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term due to his handling of the prolonged iraq war hurricane katrina and the 2008 financial crisis bush was succeeded on january 20 2009 by a democratic president barack obama

combination of slower healthcost growth and budget cuts the latter championed by republicans many more people have health insurance thanks to mr obama's health law more people are graduating from

    question_text: the new deal the great society and watergate helped solidify democratic control of congress but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition when the popularity of democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with congress' governing capacities the strongly liberal policies of clinton's first two years in office were also a cause of controversy and the democrats suddenly lost control of the house and the senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections once in power house republicans led by newt gingrich faced the difficulty of learning to govern after 40 years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their contract with america which they unveiled on the steps of congress on september 27 1994along with strong backing from traditional democrats and liberals clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who appreciated his centrist new democrat policies which steered away from the expansion of government services of the new deal and great society and allowed him to triangulate taking away many of the republicans' top issues one example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996 the new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments but did allow states to exempt 20 of their caseloads from the time limits clinton also pursued tough federal anticrime measures steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs and calling for the hiring of 100000 new police officers compromise came with difficulty though as the parties failed to agree on a budget causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996 by the end of his administration the federal government had experienced the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus the first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the social security trust fundin the 1996 presidential election clinton faced bob dole republican senator from kansas an uninspired insider dole failed to attract the support of the gop base and the incumbent president pulled to victory in the november election ross perot ran for a second time but was not allowed at the debate between clinton and dole and failed to attract as much support as he had in 1992 as a sign of the general cynicism and voter apathy during this period turnout for the election was only 49many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook longstanding rumors of extramarital affairs by clinton deeming them irrelevant these matters came to a head however in february 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between clinton and a white house intern monica lewinsky clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky his wife hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a vast rightwing conspiracy clinton was forced to retract his assertions in august 1998 after the lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel kenneth starr clinton was impeached in the united states house of representatives but acquitted at his trial by the us senate a public backlash forced speaker gingrich to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections in 1999 republican dennis hastert of illinois became speaker of the house a position he would hold until 2007 making him the longestserving republican speaker of the house

vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote early in his term bush signed a 13 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the economy but the wars in the middle east as well as assorted domestic spending packages passed by the republican congress led to ballooning federal deficits other laws enacted in his first term included the no child left behind act education reform bill in 2002 the partialbirth abortion ban act in 2003 and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act in 2004 the first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful however it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end the year 2001 was plagued by a ninemonth recession witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance with output increasing only 03 and unemployment and business failures risingon september 11 2001 alqaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the world trade

possessed chemical and nuclear weapons and posed a clear and present danger to stability in the middle east plans for a fullscale military invasion of the country began amid widespread controversy antiwar protests occurred around the us and numerous other countries mostly carried out by leftwing organizations but some on the right and various military and diplomatic figures also doubted the wisdom of this venture regardless the invasion of iraq commenced on march 20 2003 the iraqi army disintegrated without much resistance and within three weeks us troops entered baghdad to an overjoyed mob of iraqi civilians who proceeded to tear down the giant statue of saddam hussein in the middle of the city bush announced on may 1 2003 from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in iraq were completed with a mission accomplished banner serving as a backdrop although the war was initially popular a guerrilla insurgency quickly began mostly by al qaeda operatives who had entered the country led by abu musab alzarqawi a wave of bombings and beheadings of captives occurred including the highly publicized killing of government contractor nick berg zarqawi was killed by us troops in 2005 ineffective policing strategies led to a mounting death toll among soldiers but eventually in 2007 a campaign known as the surge began where the us army launched a largescale antiterrorism offensive along with the help of iraqi locals unhappy with the destruction caused by largely foreigner al qaeda agents the surge resulted in the end of most major violence in the country late in 2003

reelected in november 2004 defeating democratic contender john kerry in the electoral vote and receiving 507 of the popular vote against john kerry's 483 republicans also made gains in both houses of congress bush's reelection was assured by support for the war on terror the dour kerry's lack of appeal to his voter base and the excessive attacks made on the president by the democrat left which helped turn public opinion against them in addition it came out that kerry a vietnam war veteran had participated in antiwar protests after returning home in 1970 including throwing away his medalssome major acts in bush's second term included the energy policy act of 2005 the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act and the troubled asset relief program after seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term bush's popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term due to his handling of the prolonged iraq war hurricane katrina and the 2008 financial crisis bush was succeeded on january 20 2009 by a democratic president barack obama

combination of slower healthcost growth and budget cuts the latter championed by republicans many more people have health insurance thanks to mr obama's health law more people are graduating from

    question_text: after 1970 the us began importing oil as consumption kept rising and the nation's oil fields became less productive throughout the 1990s the world price of crude oil range between 10 and 40 and the average price at the pump did not exceed 140 oil prices tripled after 2002 peaking at 147 in july 2008 about 4 a gallon the price has continued to fluctuate widely the theme of energy independence led to legislation mandating more fuel efficient autos—even electric vehicles—and more efficient use of energy ranging from insulation to new light bulbs even worse than the high price was the fear of shortages many proposals and pilot projects for replacement energy sources from ethanol to wind power and solar power were discussed and indeed funded by congress after 2000 in the economic stimulus package signed by president obama in early 2009 billions of dollars were allocated for research and development of new energy sourceswhile public attention focused on supplies from the middle east the main source was actually canada after 2007 new methods of extraction opened up vast new deposits of oil in the bakken formation in north dakota and montana as much as two trillion dollars worth of natural gas is potentially available in the marcellus formation deposits located in the historic 19thcentury oil fields in appalachia stretching from west virginia through pennsylvania into western new york however there is sharp debate underway regarding the environmental impact on the region's fresh water supply the question of drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr was highly controversial as republican proposals were blocked by the democrats in congress republicans in 2008 were campaigning for more offshore drilling with the slogan drill baby drill but the 2010 gulf oil spill put all new drilling on hold

    question_text: following the success of the first gulf war george h w bush enjoyed very high approval ratings as president however economic recession and a reneged campaign pledge dogged bush sinking his formerly high approval ratings from the high 80s to the lower 40s and upper 30s in the wake of bush's political problems bill clinton won the 1992 contest with 43 of the vote in a three way race against bush's 38 independent candidate ross perot tapped the discontent of the electorate with both parties drawing roughly evenly from both candidates to receive a record 19 of the popular vote but no electoral votes perot's result qualified his reform party to receive federal election commission matching funds for campaign contributions in the 1996 election thus laying the groundwork for another threeway race during the 1996 presidential electionaged 46 when he took office in january 1993 clinton was one of the youngest presidents in us history and the first born after wwii historians and political analysts immediately referred to him as marking a generational shift in american politics similar to when john f kennedy had become the first president born in the 20th century his promising to focus on and resolve some of the united states' many domestic issues he entered office with high expectations immediately however he was hurt when he had to withdraw major nominees over nonpayment of taxes clinton's surgeon general jocelyn elders attracted controversy over public remarks that it would be good for parents to teach their children about masturbation much of his planned activity was overwhelmed by the intense debate over his proposal to permit gays to serve in the military in addition the president had a difficult time gaining the respect of the us military establishment due to having been painted as a vietnam war draft dodger the outcome was a new don't ask don't tell compromise policy and loss of initiative in other areasone early domestic victory of the clinton administration was the enactment of the 1994 assault weapons ban the ban was widely decried by the republicans who allowed it to lapse in 2004 while they controlled both congress and the presidency bill clinton's proposal of a national health care system championed by his wife hillary rodham clinton ignited a political firestorm on the right which vigorously opposed it on the general principle that government size should be reduced not expanded the proposed system did not survive the debate however hillary clinton did succeed along with a bipartisan coalition of members of congress in establishing the children's health insurance program

    question_text: the new deal the great society and watergate helped solidify democratic control of congress but the 1980s and early 1990s were a period of fragmentation of their coalition when the popularity of democratic incumbents as constituent servants masked growing disenchantment with congress' governing capacities the strongly liberal policies of clinton's first two years in office were also a cause of controversy and the democrats suddenly lost control of the house and the senate for the first time in four decades in the 1994 midterm elections once in power house republicans led by newt gingrich faced the difficulty of learning to govern after 40 years as the minority party while simultaneously pursuing their contract with america which they unveiled on the steps of congress on september 27 1994along with strong backing from traditional democrats and liberals clinton was able to garner the support of moderates who appreciated his centrist new democrat policies which steered away from the expansion of government services of the new deal and great society and allowed him to triangulate taking away many of the republicans' top issues one example of such compromises was welfare reform legislation signed into law in 1996 the new law required welfare recipients to work as a condition of benefits and imposed limits on how long individuals may receive payments but did allow states to exempt 20 of their caseloads from the time limits clinton also pursued tough federal anticrime measures steering more federal dollars toward the war on drugs and calling for the hiring of 100000 new police officers compromise came with difficulty though as the parties failed to agree on a budget causing the federal government to shut down in late 1995 into early 1996 by the end of his administration the federal government had experienced the country's longest economic expansion and produced a budget surplus the first year of the budget surplus was also the first year since 1969 in which the federal government did not borrow from the social security trust fundin the 1996 presidential election clinton faced bob dole republican senator from kansas an uninspired insider dole failed to attract the support of the gop base and the incumbent president pulled to victory in the november election ross perot ran for a second time but was not allowed at the debate between clinton and dole and failed to attract as much support as he had in 1992 as a sign of the general cynicism and voter apathy during this period turnout for the election was only 49many voters in 1992 and 1996 had been willing to overlook longstanding rumors of extramarital affairs by clinton deeming them irrelevant these matters came to a head however in february 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between clinton and a white house intern monica lewinsky clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky his wife hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a vast rightwing conspiracy clinton was forced to retract his assertions in august 1998 after the lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel kenneth starr clinton was impeached in the united states house of representatives but acquitted at his trial by the us senate a public backlash forced speaker gingrich to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections in 1999 republican dennis hastert of illinois became speaker of the house a position he would hold until 2007 making him the longestserving republican speaker of the house

vote winner did not receive at least a plurality of the popular vote early in his term bush signed a 13 trillion federal tax cut aimed at revitalizing the economy but the wars in the middle east as well as assorted domestic spending packages passed by the republican congress led to ballooning federal deficits other laws enacted in his first term included the no child left behind act education reform bill in 2002 the partialbirth abortion ban act in 2003 and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act in 2004 the first eight months of his term in office were relatively uneventful however it had become clear by that time that the economic boom of the late 1990s was at an end the year 2001 was plagued by a ninemonth recession witnessing the end of the boom psychology and performance with output increasing only 03 and unemployment and business failures risingon september 11 2001 alqaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and attacked the world trade

possessed chemical and nuclear weapons and posed a clear and present danger to stability in the middle east plans for a fullscale military invasion of the country began amid widespread controversy antiwar protests occurred around the us and numerous other countries mostly carried out by leftwing organizations but some on the right and various military and diplomatic figures also doubted the wisdom of this venture regardless the invasion of iraq commenced on march 20 2003 the iraqi army disintegrated without much resistance and within three weeks us troops entered baghdad to an overjoyed mob of iraqi civilians who proceeded to tear down the giant statue of saddam hussein in the middle of the city bush announced on may 1 2003 from an aircraft carrier that major combat operations in iraq were completed with a mission accomplished banner serving as a backdrop although the war was initially popular a guerrilla insurgency quickly began mostly by al qaeda operatives who had entered the country led by abu musab alzarqawi a wave of bombings and beheadings of captives occurred including the highly publicized killing of government contractor nick berg zarqawi was killed by us troops in 2005 ineffective policing strategies led to a mounting death toll among soldiers but eventually in 2007 a campaign known as the surge began where the us army launched a largescale antiterrorism offensive along with the help of iraqi locals unhappy with the destruction caused by largely foreigner al qaeda agents the surge resulted in the end of most major violence in the country late in 2003

reelected in november 2004 defeating democratic contender john kerry in the electoral vote and receiving 507 of the popular vote against john kerry's 483 republicans also made gains in both houses of congress bush's reelection was assured by support for the war on terror the dour kerry's lack of appeal to his voter base and the excessive attacks made on the president by the democrat left which helped turn public opinion against them in addition it came out that kerry a vietnam war veteran had participated in antiwar protests after returning home in 1970 including throwing away his medalssome major acts in bush's second term included the energy policy act of 2005 the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act and the troubled asset relief program after seeing high approval ratings for much of his first term bush's popularity plummeted to record lows in his second term due to his handling of the prolonged iraq war hurricane katrina and the 2008 financial crisis bush was succeeded on january 20 2009 by a democratic president barack obama

electionsunder the new congress which had a republican house and a democratic senate president obama and congress clashed for months over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to

the world's strongest right now yet the great 21stcentury wage slowdown continues with pay raises for most workers still meager in other positive news the deficit has fallen sharply thanks to a combination of slower healthcost growth and budget cuts the latter championed by republicans many more people have health insurance thanks to mr obama's health law more people are graduating from college — although mr obama is likely to fall short of his vow to have the united states lead the world in college graduates by 2020on the negative side climate change appears to be accelerating creating serious health and economic risks the fall in gasoline prices though welcome for many struggling families won't help the climate and with mr obama delivering his address the day after martin
